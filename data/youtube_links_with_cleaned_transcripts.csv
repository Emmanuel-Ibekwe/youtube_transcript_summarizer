It 's the first time they 've gone to the polls since last year 's disputed presidential election . Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro cast his vote in the capital Karacus . Opposition leaders called for a boycott of the vote and a low turnout is expected . This is the first election to be held in the disputed oilrich region of Eskibbo . Eskibbo is internationally recognized as part of neighboring Guyana . [ Music ] We can speak now to DW correspondent Oscar Schlenko who 's normally based in Kurakus but joins me now from Austin , Texas . Oscar , thanks so much for your time . Now , Venezuelan 's opposition says that these elections are a sham . They 're calling for a boycott . So , what are you hearing about how the election day is going ? , from the reports I 'm receiving , the videos posted online , and the accounts of experts , there has been very low turnout to the voting polls . Even in the centers where the government has its strongholds , turnout has n't surpassed 20 % . And that is very low for Venezuelan standards . Some experts are calculating the overall turnout to be between 15 to 19 % , which would be a historical low turnout for this type of elections . And so given what you 've just said , what type of result can be expected from that ? , the result will be favorable for the government . They handpicked their candidates for the regional offices and expect to win even with low turnout . Of course , we are expecting the electoral council to announce a higher turnout than what we are seeing . this low turnout as you said was expected not only because of the lack of trust people have in the system since the last presidential election but there were also several factors that the government made since the voting system that just did n't seem all that fair or free for example they eliminated the QR codes from the ballots which was one of the safeguards the opposition used in the presidential elections last year to prove to the world that they indeed had won the elections let 's talk a bit more about this lack of trust because Nicholas Maduro was essentially accused of stealing the presidential election last July . And given these elections happening now , how much faith do Venezuelans still have in the electoral process ? , not that much . And we can see that in today 's low turnout . trust in the system is not something that worries Maduro 's authoritarian administration because they have already announced that they will do a complete reform to all the electoral laws and system and that will limit who and how voting will take place from now on . Oscar , people are also voting in the region of Esakibbo , but this is internationally recognized as being part of neighboring Guyana , not Venezuela . So what 's going on here ? . , the dispute over the Eskivo is the oldest territorial dispute in history today . the area is controlled by Guana . So , the Venezuelan election of officials is being done in Venezuelan cities and towns close to the border and it has been called by some of the candidates as a symbolic position . However , the designation of a governor and other officials to the National Assembly is intended to put pressure in the dispute and to have a permanent representation in Venezuela 's National Assembly or Congress with the election of these officials today . Thanks so much for that , Oscar . That 's our correspondent Oscar Schlanka there on the Venezuelan elections . Thank you . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/xdL8ZfhLMkw?si=Wv_uWwDxIttAtLrJ,Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi wins Cannes' top prize for revenge thriller,DW news,xdL8ZfhLMkw,"Iranian dissident filmmaker Jaffa Panahi has won the top prize at this year 's can film festival . Panahi was awarded the coveted palm door or golden palm for his revenge thriller . It was just an accident . The winner was chosen by a nine member jury led by Juliet Dino . Kane called for freedom in his country as he accepted the award . And let 's go now to Khan where we find a DW culture correspondent Scott Roxboro . Scott , what convinced the jury ultimately to award the palm door to Panahi ? . I think it was a combination of things . it 's the film itself which is one of his best . It 's as you say , it 's a revenge thriller , but it 's really incredibly political . it 's about a group of political prisoners . who are outside now in Tran and they think they recognize their former torturer on the street . So they kidnap him and then debate whether to kill him or forgive him . So it is a thriller almost Hitchcockian in its suspense but also raises ethical questions of the true meaning of vengeance and justice . the other reason that I think Paneah won the palm door this year is because of the man he is . he is probably the most famous distant director in the world . He 's been a few years ago he was in prison in Iran . He had been under a 20 - year ban on film making and was banned from leaving the country . Those bans were fairly recently lifted and he was able to make this film from outside a prison , but he is really a symbol of artistic pol resistance against authoritarianism . And I think that as much as the film itself was the reason he won . . What else stood out to you in this year 's competition ? , it 's interesting because Khan tends to present itself as a filmmakers festival . a festival that focuses on cinema and not on the politics around the cinema . but this year was a bit different . a lot of the issues that are on everyone 's mind these days , Ukraine , Gaza , they were present here at the festival both in on the screen . There were documentaries and feature films dealing directly with the issues in Ukraine and in Gaza and on the red carpet at the press conferences here where filmmakers referred to these issues which were very outspoken in their political statements , something you really have n't seen here in previous years . the other thing I have to say is this was probably one of the best years in terms of just the quality of cinema on screen . Yafar Panani of course mentioned , but there was a stream of other incredible films , some from quite young filmmakers , which gives hope for the future of cinema . Scott , less than a minute , but I do want to ask you this . I ca n't leave without asking you about the power outage in can . I 've been to that festival before . There are so many logistical issues to deal with , not to mention a lot of consumption going on . Talk to us briefly about the drama this must have caused . , this is the cliffhanger to end the festival yesterday . we had a power outage in the in the morning . apparently as a result of sabotage at power plant outside the city cut the power in the entire city . luckily the pala the center of the festival which is behind me has its own power supply . So that kicked in quite quickly and it was clear from very early on that the festival would go ahead that the ceremony would go ahead . But there were a number of hours where no one could get a co coffee . No one could buy anything with a credit card and people went into a small little panic thinking the world was about to end . But it was very much first world problems and after a couple of hours power was back on and the festival continued as planned . How how can we live without our croissants ? that is Scott Roxboro from can . Many thanks Scott ."
https://youtu.be/dnhygtfZ_Oo?si=vjdGBou2yadYcS7S,How credible are Trump's new tariff threats?,DW news,dnhygtfZ_Oo,"The European Union has responded to Donald Trump 's newest threats on trade . EU Trade Commissioner Maros Stefkovich said mutual respect is needed and not tariffs . The US president had reignited global tensions by threatening to impose a 50 % tariff on imports from the European Union . Trump accuses EU member states of using unfair trade practices . In his view , they even include value added tax and lawsuits against American companies with companies which he calls unjustified . Trump said the EU is running a huge goods trade surplus with America and that negotiations to reduce this are going nowhere . US and European stocks tumbled in response to his remarks . In a statement from the Oval Office , Trump renewed his pressure on European companies to move production to the US . I 'm not looking for a deal . , we 've set the deal . It 's at 50 % . But again , there is no tariff if they build their plant here . Now , if somebody comes in and wants to build a plant here , I can talk to them about a little bit of a delay . With us now is Mika Alda , member of the European Parliament . He belongs to the group of the Conservative European People 's Party and to the Committee on International Trade in the EU 's Parliament . now Mika Trump threatens the EU with tariffs again this time 50 % . What 's your reaction ? of course he loves big words and big numbers and that has been the main challenge . his transactionalism he wants to talk big numbers symbolic wins particularly when it comes to his constituencies his main base . so he wants to have billions in investments what happened during the Gulf trip . He wants to talk that type of talk and with the European Union that is very difficult because Europe is more institutionalist . It is not transactionalist . So things take time and then there 's political constraints as well . So a talking the Trump talk would alienate voters in Europe and that of course is impossible for the commissioners currently . Now let me Donald Trump here . He said our talks with them that 's the EU are going nowhere . is that consistent with the picture that you have gained of the negotiations ? , I understand that talks have been ongoing . the problem is that we do not know who calls the shots in Washington . So , when the commissioner of trade travels to Washington , he talks with relevant counterparties there , but what is actual Trump 's inner circle ? Do we have contact to that ? and does that then necessitate that we start to talk the numbers game about big investments to us . So negotiations have been ongoing but the issue is that I 've been negotiating with the people when we are negotiating with the relevant counterparties . Now Trump has recently spoken a lot about tariffs . He 's introduced them then suspended them again . How credible is he anyway ? , he that 's his style of negotiating and as I said , what he wants is to have big announcements coming from European Union about supporting his way of doing politics and so we have a choice . We we enter into that type of negotiation . So then we have some backbone and we stand our ground and then at the end he usually gives in . So it is also a game of chicken . So both parties and he himself is racing towards the eds in a very speedy manner and he believes that the European Union will give in . although we have to I have to remind that his numbers are not very correct . taking into account the services the balance of trade transatlantically is relatively even . Thank you very much Mika Ala member of the European Parliament . Thank you ."

Each side handed over 307 soldiers a day after exchanging another 390 each . Meanwhile , at least 15 people have been injured in a largecale Russian drone and missile attack focused on the Ukrainian capital Ke . With ceasefire efforts otherwise stalled , Ukraine 's president Vladimir Zilinski said new international sanctions are needed to force Russia to agree to a truce . Ukraine 's air defense system fights to keep Russian missiles at bay after Keev came under heavy attack in the early hours of Saturday . It was one of the largest aerial assaults on the capital since the war began and followed a major prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine just hours earlier . Emergency services searched buildings that were hit by drones and missiles and evacuated residents from burning homes . As dawn broke , people in Kev began to inspect the damage . Putin does n't want to end the war . I wish they 'd agree to a ceasefire to bomb people this . Poor children . My three - year - old granddaughter was screaming and scared . War is war , and no one is safe from it here . Our enemy is particularly vicious and immoral . The kids called me at 3 this morning screaming , "" Mom , we were hit . The balcony is on fire . "" Writing on social media , President Zalinski said it had been a tough night for his country and called the attack a fresh demonstration that Vladimir Putin is not serious about bringing an end to his invasion of Ukraine . , I 'm now joined by DW correspondent Rebecca in KE . Rebecca , how serious was this latest attack ? , it was certainly very loud in the capital as you heard in that report . Pretty scary night . I can attest to attest to that . It was a incredibly loud . We were hearing gunshots . That 's the air defense . the working all night . We could hear even the drones in the city where I was . and some of the interceptions as well . Definitely a sleepless night for many people here in the capital as you saw in that report . many spending the night in bomb shelters or in fact in the metro system where many people go during these attacks . It was certainly one of the biggest , not the biggest , but one of the biggest that we 've seen in Kiev in recent weeks and months and definitely a very terrifying night for many here . Of course , Kiev was one of the major targets , but it was n't the only place targeted . And we had President Zalinski saying that there were there were we saw attacks in Nepro in Odessa in Sunumi region just to name a few . So also pointing out really reiterating in his remarks about these attacks that this is just proof that Russia is simply not serious about any ceasefire any peace negotiations . And then on the other hand , we witness and you 've personally witnessed the largest exchange of prisoners and civilians since 2022 . The second phase is now underway . How is that going ? , we 've just been hearing that the second tranch 307 prisoners have now been brought back and they 're in on Ukrainian territory . I should say yesterday we saw 390 and they 're going to hopefully equal tomorrow . drove all goes to plan . We 'll have another 3003 if my mathematics is correct and that will make thou a thousand prisoners . So it 's 1,000 for a thousand that was agreed upon in talks in Istanbul last week . Now it 's certainly a step in the direction but Zilinsky said it was the only concrete thing to come out of the talks and that other than that the talks simply were Vladimir Putin just wasting time buying time . but of course it is a step in the direction as I just said and we were there yesterday . It was a really emotional day as we were watching families reunited and also very bittersweet as we watched a lot of people who were there waiting for some information from their relatives . Let 's take a look at how it unfolded . An agonizing wait ends in tears of joy and relief . 270 soldiers and 120 civilians have returned home . Some spent months , others years in Russian captivity . Many tell us they had no idea they were being released . We were outside . They took pictures of us . Then we were brought with a prison transport vehicle to a plane and then to the Bellarus border control . when we arrived . It was only after the blindfolds were taken off . Only after that we understood that this was an exchange . Many returnees bear wounds of war or are battling poor [ Music ] health . Nadia 's husband ca n't hug her just yet . Infected with tuberculosis , he 's quickly moved into isolation . Thank God he 's home . For many families who waited near the border , there were no joyous reunions . They 're hoping the freed prisoners have news about their relatives . So , you 'll see these people here . They 're anxiously waiting . They 're holding pictures of their loved ones , hoping that the people who have been released will be able to give them some notification . Perhaps they 'd seen them in one of the detention centers . Perhaps , , they 've seen them along the way and they can give some information about their loved ones . This prisoner swap was the only concrete agreement to come out of talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul last week . The return of our people is exactly what we are always working for . And now is definitely the time to put more pressure on Russia so that we achieve not just one result , but everything that is needed . For now , it 's time for these former prisoners to hold their families close and build back the lives they 've missed so much of . I really want to see my son . He 's three years old . I have n't seen him . He was born on February 21st and on the 24th the war began . 37 months is a huge achievement . It 's had a big impact on our relationship . Is Dor alive . Thank you God . [ Music ] Russia 's foreign minister Sege Lavrov says Moscow will give Keeve conditions for what he calls a sustainable long - term and comprehensive peace agreement once the prisoner exchange is concluded . Rebecca , do we have any information about what those conditions might be ? , there apparently the Russians that is drafting a memorandum that they say that they will submit to Ukraine after this prisoner swap has taken place . President Zalinski has said that this memorandum is a mockery to the world . The fact that it 's taking them so long to write it . It 's just simply , , Russia buying more time . We do n't have any information about what 's going to be inside the memorandum . But if we take the words and some of what we 've been hearing that came out of the talks in Istanbul last week and other things that the Russians have said in the past , we can expect that in the memorandum , they 'll be calling for these maximus maximalist demands . And that is of course ordering Ukrainian troops to move away from any territory near where Russia has occupied . that they want to take wholeheartedly those areas even though they have n't occupied the whole areas there . They want Ukraine to give up any aspirations of joining NATO and even the EU . And there are many other , , very severe demands that are really Ukraine 's red lines . So really , whatever is going to come out in that memorandum , it 's unlikely to be something that Ukraine can agree to . And as I said , President Zalinski already just calling it a mockery . The correspondent Rebecca Reta reporting from Keefe in Ukraine . Thank you very much , Rebecca ."

Just past the village , separatist South Oetia begins . The Russian soldiers stationed there have residents here in northern Georgia , living in fear of their neighbor . Leah Kahitzi lives just meters from the checkpoint . She set up a little museum in her basement dedicated to the 2008 war between Georgia and Russia . , I truly see Russia as Georgia 's eternal enemy . Russia is an enemy to me and not a brother . The 72 - year - old was an eyewitness to Russian tanks rolling through Ernati in August 2008 , allegedly to protect citizens of South Oetia . Leah remembers things differently . After the 5 - day war ended , her husband was left dead and her house gutted by fire . Leah does n't want these events to be forgotten because she says the conflict has never really ended . A hybrid war is underway today . Russia is no longer fighting us with bullets . It 's fighting us psychologically . A creeping occupation is taking place which is one of our most painful issues and most importantly the falsification of history . That is why it 's necessary to preserve it . , how are you ? Gordalata is also worried . She lives in Ozogeti in western Georgia . Irma would to see her country join the European Union . She promotes the idea in the villages of her region . Being part of the EU would grant us peace and protect us from the aggressor Russia . We would make economic progress and achieve greater awareness of fundamental rights . But not everyone here shares Irma 's opinion . She frequently hears people claim society in the EU is overly liberal . For instance , when it comes to the LGBTQ plus community , a woman 's a woman , a man 's a man . That 's blowing things out of proportion . I do n't want to send my son abroad to study . He come back wearing a dress . I do n't want that . While these views reflect beliefs held by some , opinions on LGBTQ plus rights in Georgia are diverse and evolving . Irma regularly attends demonstrations that have been going on for months in Tiblisi , a 6 - hour drive away . Here , -minded protesters come together every evening in support of Georgia joining the EU . But the government ended accession talks , shifting to an authoritarian pro - Russian course . They are finding and imprisoning demonstrators , sometimes resorting to violence . Back home , Irma and her fellow residents regularly produce videos for social media and warn viewers about Russia . Until now , the US administration had been supporting civil society groups in Georgia . Ma is concerned about the US 's recent turn towards Russia . Trump 's so - called policy showing loyalty towards Putin puts us in a tricky situation . The geopolitical situation is generally not great for us , especially with such uncertainty . All our hopes are resting on the EU . MA knows her efforts are a thorn in the side of the pro - Russian administration , and that might cost her teaching job at some point , but she would n't even consider giving up . I may often feel hopeless , uncertain , even confused . But I try not to let it show because there are so many people beside me and behind me . And if I break down , I know I bear a responsibility . Leah also viewed the US as Georgia 's protector . What about now ? I do n't Trump 's attitude towards Putin . It should not be loyal , but rather a tough policy because Putin is a recognized murderer . Many of Leah 's neighbors have left Ergniti in recent years , in part because of the Russian troops nearby . For Leah , that 's out of the question . Her husband is buried here . She 's staying and hoping that her dream of Georgia joining the EU will come true . [ Music ]"

The tension is palpable in Gerlet and Ziggoich . Yakub Pulinski crosses the border almost every day and is frustrated by controls . He comes from Ziggoich but lives with his family in Geritz . Last year he filed a complaint against the controls . [ Music ] These checks make our lives more difficult here along the border . It 's just unpleasant . You feel a criminal who 's done something wrong when all you 're doing is heading home from visiting your grandparents . Family visits , doctor 's appointments . For many here , crossing the border is routine . But each time they enter Germany , they run the risk of being checked or getting stuck in endless traffic jams . Last year , after being stopped several times , Wolinsky had enough and sued Germany . He 's convinced Germany is violating the Shenan agreement , and many are angry . Sunday and Monday on the Polish side , the whole city is one big traffic jam . It 's terrible considering we live in one city here . Our children often go to kindergarten on the German side . what they 're doing , it 's just detrimental to us . It really ca n't go on . The controls are clearly a burden on residents here . But on the German side , some welcome them because asylum seekers who 've already applied in Poland are being turned away . I do n't think it 's such a bad thing when you consider that municipalities and cities have reached their limits . It 's a policy that I personally put up with and hope that it 's not permanent . The mayor of Gerlets understands Po 's anger about the controls , but sees them as necessary to limit migration . He does n't feel concerned about neighborly relations here and hopes for a European solution . Our crossber relationship is n't affected , but of course it 's a bit inconvenient to have extra border obstructions . But now that there 's discussion at the European level , I expect everyone will soon come to an agreement and that such internal border controls will no longer be necessary . Stronger controls at the EU 's external borders could help . They 're also being pushed for in neighboring Poland where the current local measures are under fire . Border controls are a problem for our cooperation with Gerlets . We 're currently preparing a petition in the form of a complaint . We believe that Germany has suspended the Shenhen agreement and that they 're in the wrong . These controls take a very long time . Jakob Folinsky hopes his case at the Dresden Administrative Court will bring the measures to an end in part because he feels singled out . Although the stops are random , he 's been checked very frequently . Here , Polish citizens face suspicion on a daily basis . We 're checked simply because we cross the border . It 's downright unfair . And that 's how we see it in Poland . Despite everything , his lawsuit is not directed against Germany or the European idea . To the contrary , he says it 's meant to help strengthen the Shenan agreement and freedom of travel within the European Union . It 's unclear how long the stricter border controls will last . The police union complains they present a major burden even for the police officers ."

Back then , she was a pioneer in Italy . Before that , she 'd lost her job at a call center . She and other striking workers occupied the company 's premises for 6 months to no avail . By the end , they were living from homegrown food her grandparents once farmed . That marked a turning point for her . My sister and I said to ourselves , "" If our grandparents could live a dignified life on a farm with a few animals , then we should also be able to make something edible out of the earth and a few hens . "" So , that 's how our adventures in agriculture began . She started by bringing her family 's farm , an hour 's drive from Florence , back to life . The fields were overgrown . It was hard [ Music ] work . With a herder , Gabriella Mikolotsi exchanged her first five goats for a few large bottles of wine . Then , as her herd grew , she traded 40 goats for 20 sheep . Still , at first , her male colleagues were n't eager to pass on any valuable tips . [ Music ] These men could n't believe that I wanted to work as a shepherd . I asked them if there was anyone who could teach me this profession or could help me . But no one wanted to . Only after a few years did that change . Today , I 'm known all over as Gabriella the Shepherdes . [ Applause ] Meanwhile , more and more Italian women want to follow in her footsteps . To make it easier for the next generation , a shepherd school opened 3 years ago in Tuscanyany . Katina Blazy has just enrolled there . It was founded by the Festi Castantine National Park . What I about this work is that I can live far removed from civilization , which is growing ever more hectic . I can just sit under a tree and watch the sheep or dogs and really get back to nature . I 've always believed that you need to do what you love without fear of being judged by others . Katarina is 30 . She studied wildlife sciences and has long been tracking the return of wolves and their growing population 's effect on sheep herds in Europe . During this time , she 's gotten to know and love the shepherd 's life . Currently , six women and two men are training to be shepherds here . Over the coming months , they 'll study biology , grazing management , animal husbandry , and agri business management . The students have the support of the Festi Casantine National Parks President Claudia Matsulli . You 're setting off on a path that is very important to us because being a shepherd means safeguarding our landscape , our habitat . that 's at risk of disappearing . She stresses that creating jobs for young people here is just as vital . A generational change is very important for us because the mountain villages of the Aenines are suffering from strong out migration and the population is aging . That makes us fear for the future . on the Shepherd School 's schedule today . Cheesem . This here is fresh sheep 's milk to which we 've added cultures . To make this cheese , it 's good to use a little room that 's kept at a constant temperature of 20 ° C. Because the milk stands here , which is now curdling , as well as the freshlymade cheese . [ Music ] The school ensures that its graduates learn the skills they 'll need to live from their dream job . Experienced shepherdis Gabriella also has some good advice for the new recruits . If you 're prepared to love the land and the animals and do n't see living such a life as making a sacrifice , on the contrary , it makes you happy , then this is the profession for you . Gabriella will soon have lots of budding shepherds and shepherdesses by her side . Unlike those men when she was starting out , she 's happy to help these young people learn the ropes . [ Music ]"
https://youtu.be/AKgSuEGbPW0?si=FroojZ_XQQV-w3r1,Why Iran's nuclear program is so important for the country | DW News,DW news,AKgSuEGbPW0,"Delegations from Iran and the US have finished a fifth round of nuclear talks in Rome mediated by Oman . The Omani foreign minister says the two sides made some progress . He said the proposals will be reviewed by both governments and another round will be scheduled accordingly . US President Donald Trump wants to limit Thyrron 's potential to produce nuclear weapons and Iran is hoping to have sanctions lifted . Trump has threatened military strikes on Iran if a deal is not reached . After the talks , Iranian Foreign Minister Abbasi said there was potential for progress . I hope that in the next one or two sessions , given the improved understanding that now exists regarding the positions of the Islamic Republic , that we can arrive at solutions that allow for progress in the negotiations . We 're not at that point yet , but we are not without hope either . Cornelius Adabar from the German Council of Foreign Relations joins us now from Bon in Germany . So , still no breakthrough , Cornelius , between the US and Iran . What are the stumbling blocks ? , the main stumbling block appears to be the question of uranium enrichment . , which is a dual use capacity . , so you need enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear energy program for a civilian nuclear reactor as much as you can use enriched uranium for a nuclear weapons program . And since this facility resides inside Iran is using it for the one nuclear reactor that it has but it can also be used and the world 's fear is that Iran may use it one day in order to acquire a nuclear weapon . and here the positions are still very much a part . , Iran insists on its to enrich uranium , which is something that other states around the world also do if they have a nuclear program . But the United States , President Trump and some other countries , they insist that Iran must give up this capacity entirely . , and that appears to be a red line for Iran at the moment . So there are dual uses for uranium , of course . Talk specifically about Iran . Why is it so important for Iran to enrich uranium ? , it 's it 's a symbol of national pride , one can say precisely because this is a capacity that Iran acquired over the past decades and it acquired autonomously . so there was some help from Pakistan at the very beginning selling designs for centrifuges to Iran . but other than that because Iran has been sidelined by the international community for decades because it had been put under sanctions especially by the United States it had to acquire this capacity this knowledge this scientific achievement u in adversity so to say and so this is for many Iranians it is and here I 'm speaking about public opinion also it is something that they ought never to give up because it shows the prowess if you of Iranian nuclear scientists regardless of the use that to which it is eventually put . so here when the foreign minister says this is this is a nogo for us , it 's really he 's speaking for many Iranians inside the country . I want to dig a little deeper to something that you just said a moment ago . You said that of course there are other countries that enrich uranium as part of a civilian nuclear energy program but do n't use it for weapons . So why does the US and other countries for that matter as you mentioned not trust Iran ? What is it about Iran that makes people doubtful , skeptical ? . , there 's two things or two sides I would I would to say . for one most obviously the nature of the Islamic Republic is n't really engendering much confidence into other states especially western or democratic states . so it 's the internal repression the awful human rights record . it 's the antagon that the regime is celebrating visav the west . It 's the enmity which is inshed in the Islamic Republic system with Israel . so all these things make Iran a very difficult actor to deal with and just the thought that this regime would have a nuclear weapon is unbearable to many around the world . But at the same time the whole nuclear file as many people call it has also been kept alive if I can say over decades . we did have an agreement with Iran to limit its nuclear program in since 2015 , the nuclear deal as it was called . which is an agreement that President Trump ripped apart in his first term . so we would n't be in today 's situation . Instead , we would be in a in a situation where Iran would have a very limited very much controlled nuclear program , civilian nuclear program with no chance of developing a nuclear weapon anytime soon . would be in this situation had n't the United States torn up the agreement . That 's Cornelius Adabar from the German Council of Foreign Relations . Thanks so much ."

So , at this point , all I can really say is here we go again . , it 's very clear that the president is interested in attempting to move production back to the United States or move production to the United States if it were not here previously . It 's obvious that whatever is being offered or how these negotiations are going so far between the United States and the European Union are not acceptable or not pleasing to the president . , the president has made clear that he has issue with various European trading practices , but clearly does not the imbalance that he sees in terms of trade between the United States and the EU . And this has n't gone down well in Europe . But if this becomes a full trade war , which side has more to lose ? Honestly , the answer to that question is no one wins in a trade war . And the biggest losers are going to be European companies , US - based companies , US consumers , as well as EU consumers . If you look at the total of goods , services , and investment , the EU and the US economy are the largest trading partners . They 're the most intimately connected out of any trading partner partnership that we see globally . And everyone loses . You 're talking about major increases in cost , major potential economic declines in Europe and in the United States . Now , we 've heard a lot from Donald Trump complaining about America 's trade deficits , in this case with Europe , that the US buys more from them than they buy from America . Is this a problem that needs fixing ? This is an excellent question because it really highlights how many people fundamentally misunderstand trade deficits . Trade deficits are not inherently bad . So , I 'll give you an example . Most people watching this program are probably in a perpetual trade deficit with their grocery store . Chances are they 've likely bought item after item and spent thousands of dollars year after year at their local grocery stores . But those grocery stores likely have yet to purchase anything from their customers . And this is not an inappropriate example to levy in the international context . What this idea of an imbalance of trade , the US importing more goods than it exports fundally fundamentally misses is that when European companies ship goods to the US and when the US ships goods to Europe , it 's not just the goods that are being exchanged . There 's also investment . And so these bilateral trade balances that may appear uneven is not really something that we need to be worried about balancing . We we 've seen the shock as this news has hit the markets . Can this volatility force Donald Trump to change course on this ? It 's difficult to say at this point . It 's obvious that markets are responding very strongly to the president 's pronouncements on trade . whether they are executive orders or in the case of this threats that are made over social media or in press discussions within the Oval Office . and so certainly there is the potential for markets to recover but as we 've seen today stocks are down in the United States , they 're down across Europe and particularly for companies who have strong footholds in both the European Union and the United States . So companies L'Oreal , BMW and Deutsche Bank all saw significant stock reductions today . Abigol , thank you very much for your insights on that . It 's Gohal , associate professor in economics at the University of Tampa . Pleasure as always ."

[ Music ] We can get more from our political correspondent , Simon Young . , Simon . What happened ? , Phil , this attack took place , as you 've said , at Hamburg 's main rail station . That 's in the center of the city , and it 's a key transport hub . where , incidentally , the carrying of weapons , including knives , is banned . Now , this happened around 6:00 this evening . it appears to have been an indiscriminate attack that took place on a platform . now there have been reports of up to 17 people injured with up to six in critical condition as you mentioned . but police in Hamburg have been saying this evening that the precise number of injured is not yet finally determined , but certainly that several people have been critically injured and obviously are receiving medical care in hospital .

https://youtu.be/_VJQ0b8qZAM?si=waF30LGhLMvU5Uqb,Russia says it will outline peace conditions amid largescale prisoner swap,DW news ,_VJQ0b8qZAM,"And Russia has announced that it 'll give Ukraine a draft document outlining conditions for a long - term peace agreement once the current prisoner exchange is completed . Today , the first phase of that swap . Each side released 390 soldiers and civilians . Now , more are due to be freed in the coming days . The swaps taking place at the border between Barus and Ukraine . An agreement to release a thousand prisoners each was the only concrete step to emerge from peace talks at in Istanbul at the weekend . It 's the largest exchange since Russia 's full - scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 . Our correspondent Rebecca Ritters has spent the day in northeastern Ukraine at the site of the prisoner swap . Rebecca . What have you seen ? Phil , it 's been an incredibly emotional day as you can imagine here . It 's been a long one for the relatives who 've been waiting to see , as is often the case with these prisoner swaps . Relatives do n't get , , notification ahead of time that their loved ones are going to be arriving . So , many have just arrived , and some of them , you 'll be able to see , are still behind me . You can see the buses and the ambulances that have been bringing the soldiers here . They come here , they get they go through a process of infiltration , they get medical treatment before they 're able to then reunite with their families . , as I say , it 's just been an incredibly emotional weight . So many people waiting to see whether their loved ones were here . We did see some really beautiful reunions . but we also saw a lot of tears of mainly women but men also people who were waiting hoping expecting their loved ones to arrive that they were n't on any of the buses . and they say that they 're going to wait as you mentioned in the lead in there . This is going to take a few days because a thousand is of course a lot of people to be distributing bringing back . So this is going to carry on over the weekend . And some of the people we spoke to said that they 'd be camping out here waiting to see whether maybe tomorrow or on Sunday they might get to see a glimpse and to be reunited with their loved ones . And h how significant should we regard this the fact that this is happening at all ? , I think it is incredibly significant . It 's certainly significant for the people involved . these people many of them spent , , some three years in Russian detention . some less of course but these families who 've been anxiously waiting it is a momentous thing you mentioned that this is the biggest prisoner swap prisoner exchange that we 've seen between Russia and Ukraine that is of course very significant it was as President Zilinski himself has said the only real concrete thing to come out of those negotiations and so in that sense it is significant President Zilinski says that prisoner swaps are a way to in some respects build trust with Russia and there is some hope that this could lead to , , future ne further negotiations . That 's certainly the tone that 's coming out of the president 's office that they 're they 're willing , they 're open . They want to see a ceasefire and they want to see a peace deal . and that 's something that the call that we heard between Putin and Trump was something that , , may be on the cards , though of course you 've got other people saying that Putin is simply just buying time . So definitely a positive step and certainly for the people involved , but whether it leads anywhere , of course , we 'll just have to wait and see . . So just talk us through how this works . Rebecca , you say there are people there waiting to see their loved ones . So presumably they 're notified and then how does the scene unfold ? Is this minivans arriving and people just spilling out ? , not everyone is notified . In fact , some when the actual prisoner stop happens , it 's up on the border . this one happened on the border with Bellarus . They 're there . Some of them are able to obviously call their loved ones , but many people just do n't know . So , you 'll see these people here , they 're anxiously waiting . They 're holding pictures of their loved ones , hoping that the people who have been released will be able to give them some notification . Perhaps they 'd seen them in one of the detention centers . perhaps , , they 've seen them along the way and they can give some information about their loved ones . , it 's was really emotional , dramatic . I was n't myself nearly in tears , I have to say . When the buses came through and the soldiers through the windows waving , some of them were crying . , and then of course they 're taken from there . It was pretty chaotic . , there 's a lot of press here . There was , , the most soldiers that we 've ever seen exchanged . So , some 270 here . and all the staff that go with that . So it was quite chaotic scenes . Everyone trying to see whether their loved ones were getting off the buses . Not everyone knows of course and then a lot of people very disappointed that they did n't find their loved ones . Then of course they go inside . They get checked medically and then they have to go through a process where they speak to the security services . Obviously , some of them may have well obviously have been under a lot of duress and so the security services here want to find out what may have been said , what may have been told to Russia , the Russian government . so , , it 's a very long process and it depends on each individual case of course , but eventually the bottom line is these people now get have returned to Ukraine and they get to go back to their families . , thanks for talking us through that Rebecca .

Hundreds are protesting against the war in Gaza there as we speak and against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . They 're demanding the immediate release of all hostages , calling on the Israeli government to strike a deal with Hamas . The demonstrators wanted to march towards the Stirat border crossing , but police have prohibited that . Our correspondent Emily Gordin is at the site of the protest . Emily , the march was forbidden . What protest are demonstrators staging instead then ? , these protesters are here at one of the biggest junctions in the Gaza envelope . We 're only about 2 to three kilometers away from the Gaza border . Beth Hanoon is an airline distance of about 5 kilometers from here . Bethan in northern Gaza was heavily destroyed in the course of this war . Now , what do these protesters want ? They want an end to the war . They want the hostages to be released . But crucially , they also want the Palestinian suffering in Gaza to end . they 're holding up , many of them are holding up pictures of the Palestinian children who were killed by Israeli air strikes . their names are written underneath their pictures in Hebrew and in Arabic . And what something that the protesters have told me is that they believe that their government is committing genocide in Gaza and that they desperately want this to end . They want this military offensive to end . They want this government , their government to be held accountable . But I think it 's also very important to say that this protest , especially here , is quite unusual . Stat , the city of Sarat , which is just around the corner from here , is a Lea Netanyahu stronghold . Many there support the course of the government . , and we 've also seen some drivers by here . One in particular who stepped out of his car after seeing the protest and attacked one of the cameramen that was covering this protest here . And I think it 's also important to mention here that while a majority of Israelis do want this war to end between 60 and 70 % their main priority is about getting the hostages out of Gaza . they are tired after 19 months of war . So while this protest is growing , it is still a minority in Israel altogether . Those DWS Emily Gordin , thanks so much ."

The deal was halted by a lastminute court injunction in the early hours of Thursday morning before being overturned just hours later allowing the handover to take place . Situated in the middle of the Indian Ocean between the Seyells and the Moldes , the Sheaos Islands are often referred to as Africa 's last colony . Britain has now officially relinquished territorial control to Maitius , but it has secured a multi - billion dollar centuryl long lease for the militarybased shares with the US on the largest of the islands , Diego Garcia . A few moments ago , I signed a deal to secure the joint UK US base on Diego Garcia . The strategic location of this base is of the utmost significance to Britain . From deploying aircraft to defeat terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan to anticipating threats in the Red Sea and the Indo - Pacific , the entire population was forced from the islands in the late 1960s .

We 're not Maicians and I do n't think we will get any the rights we asking for now . We 've been fighting for 60 years .

Homeland Security Secretary Christy Gnome ordered the move , which is part of an escalating battle between the Trump administration and America 's oldest university . Around 6,800 foreign students are enrolled at Harvard , more than a quarter of the student body . University officials say the action is illegal . All . , for more on this , we 're now joined by Nick Arian . He 's a lawyer and former assistant Watergate prosecutor and also was in Harvard . He joins us now from New York City . H great to have you on the show . So , the Homeland the Homeland Security Secretary says this action is being taken because Harvard has failed to adhere to the law . Harvard has called the move unlawful . What 's your take ? There 's no question this is absolutely an outrageous move by the Trump administration . There is no nothing unlawful that Harvard has done . in fact what the administration is claiming is that Harvard is fostering anti - semitism . and this is from Donald Trump who had two of the biggest anti - semites in the United States at his Mara Lago estate for dinner last year . Nick Fuentes and Cain West . So this is nothing more than a pretext for the administration to try and take over how the university is operated . If you saw the letter that they initially sent to Harvard , aside from this whole issue of foreign students , they were looking to be able to decide who could be admitted to Harvard , who could be hired at Harvard , they wanted to have an ongoing audit of what was going on at Harvard . This is an effort to take over the academic freedom of Harvard University . So , what can Harvard do legally to stop this action from the Trump administration then ? , I think what they 're going to do is go into court . They 'll probably get a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction halting this order . In fact , just today on the West Coast , a federal district court judge , I believe in the Northern District of California , issued an order preventing the Trump administration from affecting the immigration or the status of any of the students in any of the colleges anywhere in the United States . So I 'm not sure how much that applies to this particular situation with Harvard , but certainly you can expect in the next day or two that the university will be going before a federal district court judge in Boston . Now how might this change or impact Harvard and other institutions across the United States from working independently ? Is the US government then overstepping ? They 're overstepping big time . Nobody has ever done this before . This has never happened in the United States that an administration has tried to take over the thought processes , the operations in how a university operates itself . this is totally unprecedented . I do n't think there 's any way that any court is going to stand for this . and ultimately I think the courts are going to come in and stop it from happening . what you 've mentioned there just now and what you were mentioning before about what 's happening in California with regards to judges . So if we zoom out a bit and we 've seen judges in the US block major changes that the Trump administration promised to introduce . One example to add to the list being the dismantling of the education department . Can the US legal system cope with the amount of changes being introduced or at least within the plans of the Trump administration 's plans to be introduced ? come they deal with at the amount they 're clearly dealing with it . It 's it 's not easy in the sense that in order to go in to fight these different moves that the Trump administration is making . Lawyers have to put together affidavits , statements by people under oath . They have to put together papers . That all takes time . And then they have to go in before a judge to try and get what is known as a temporary restraining order . and they 've been doing that . And then after 10 days , they have to come in and put on proof for a preliminary injunction , which is a more permanent injunction that lasts throughout the tenure of the case . , and in some cases , with respect to law firms , , one of them has already gotten summary judgement where there 's a permanent injunction in place now . So , all of this takes time . The legal system does n't work as quickly as the executive branch can work . , but it 's certainly doing one hell of a job at this point . Nick , really great to have you on the show and to get your insights and expertise . , Nick Arian , a lawyer who 's covered , some very high - profile government investigations in the United States , joining us tonight from New York . Take care , Nick . Thanks . Thank you . Bye - bye ."

In an escalating battle between the Trump administration and the Ivy League institution , was gnome accused the school of fostering violence and anti - semitism and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party . University officials say the move is illegal and amounts to retaliation . Current foreign students will have to transfer to other universities or lose their legal status . Let 's get more from our correspondent Benjamin Alvarez Gruber in Washington DC . Welcome Ben . Talk us through what 's happened . So the Trump administration ended the ability of Harvard University to enroll future international students and to retain those who are currently enrolled at the university . So international students will a need to transfer to another university or b lose the legal status . You just mentioned Christine Noim , the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security . She ordered DHS staff to revoke the so - called student and exchange visitor program certification which allows colleges to enroll foreign students . And she said that this decision serves as a warning she said to all universities or academic institutions across the country . She 's accusing Harvard of what she says is fostering violence . She also said it 's fostering anti - semitism and also she accused them of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus . And that 's not only what she is saying , but also Republicans that have accused Harvard of giving China access to research that could be misused against the United States . How 's Harvard reacting ? So , we 're still waiting for another press statement , an official press statement from Harvard University that will challenge this as illegal . We can also expect to hear more from judges , but just looking at their homepage news and statements . There have been two statements posted recently showing that this is nothing new , the tension that we 're seeing between Harvard University and the Trump administration . One of these press statements are on funding threats by the Trump administration where the university said that it will continue to defend itself against what it called is illegal government overreach aimed at stiffing research and innovation that makes America safer and more secure . And another one accusing the Trump government of posing a threat to advances in health but also of science . But this department , this decision of the Department of Homeland Security only shows the tensions that are growing further with this decision . It will impact a third of the students of the university because as of fall of 2023 international students comprised more than 27 % of Harvard 's total enrollment according to university data . . So clearly there is a history to this . Remind us of that history . this animosity between the Trump administration and Harvard there is a history . So we had on one side presidential threats investigations also extensive funding cats that began as the work of this task force that President Trump commissioned what he said to address anti - semitism on campus . So this efforts involved several investigations spanning at least six agencies . We have the department of justice of education of health and human services and especially with Harvard these increasingly punitive action have come after Harvard resisted many of the changes that the administration wanted to see on admission on curriculum on hiring practices and here we see that the oldest and also the wealthiest university of this country is not backing down and we can expect and see also what the Trump administration is trying to do here to send signal as DHS Secretary Christine Nim said to all the other universities to see what will happen to them if they not follow what the Trump administration wants them to do when it comes to enrollment and also when it comes to their international students . So we can expect that there will be a backlash and also that there will be more reactions from not just from Harvard University but also from academia in general against this new decision by the Trump administration . Thanks Ben . DW correspondent Benjamin Alvarez Gruba in Washington ."

Delegates from the Middle East and Europe were among those in Janine when the shots rang out . Now , this footage captures the moment the group of 20 was being briefed on the situation in Janine and they were giving interviews to journalists when they heard gunshots . No injuries have been reported . The Israeli military says that its soldiers had to fire warning shots because the delegation deviated from the route that they had been approved for their visit . They have apologized for the incident . And for more now , I want to bring in DW 's Tanya Kramer in Jerusalem . Tanya , good to see you . What more do we know about this incident and what is Israel saying about it ? , just give you a bit more background to this visit though . This visit was organized by the Palestinian Authority . for those diplomats from there were over 20 diplomats from regional European and other western countries on this visit to Janine in the northern West Bank and they were there to observe the humanitarian situation because as there have been since several weeks and since January about the Israeli military is operating there extensively and tens of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced . because of that military operation and the camps themselves . There was another visit on Monday to Tularam also in the north . Now this was today to Janine and the camps themselves are almost off limits to enter . Now this was a tour with those diplomats . There were also media present as you said the video shows those shots being fired and the Israeli military put out this statement saying that it was a visit . They acknowledge it was coordinated with the Palestinian Authority , but the delegation deviated from the approved route and soldiers fired these warning shots to distance the delegation . But you can clearly see they 're standing behind a gate that was erect to close the refugee camp off from there . So we already have a fallout diplomatically . many of the home capitals of those diplomats have put out statements clearly condemning this asking for further investigation . We heard from the EU foreign policy chief Miss Kalis saying that even warning shots are unacceptable . Any threats to diplomats lives are unacceptable . , and this comes of course as there are already high tensions between many countries in the U and other western nations with Israel over its conduct in Gaza but also in the occupied West Bank . , DW 's Tanya Kramer with the latest in Jerusalem on this incident . Tanya , thank you ."
https://youtu.be/1T8Nlmipvkc?si=zpcdBk7nAJ4s9Rxg,Ukraine has started evacuating people from Sumy region |,DW news,1T8Nlmipvkc,"Ukrainian authorities have begun evacuating people from dozens of locations in the Suma region near the border with Russia . So far , officials have brought over 50,000 people to safety , according to the region 's military governor . He says that 's half the number of civilians who need to evacuate . Russia has been heavily attacking Suma for months . On the other side of the border , Russian President Vladimir Putin has visited Ksk for the first time since Russia said it expelled Ukrainian forces in April . He visited a nuclear plant which is under construction . I asked military analyst Frank Ledwitch if there are signs of a big Russian offensive coming to Suma . , good morning Ben . Big I would say , but certainly of sufficient significance to attract the attention or considerable attention on the part of the Ukrainian defenses . The Russians have put together what they 've called a northern group of forces in that area . Essentially , they 've moved from Kursk following the somewhat lackluster Ukrainian withdrawal from there earlier this year into Sunumi region to create a buffer zone . But there does n't seem to be much in the way of bulk or coordination in this . Not nonetheless , undoubtedly the Ukrainians are anticipating a reasonablesized operation in the near future and that 's why they 're evacuating that border area . Is that what this has come down to in this war ? Creating Russia creating buffer zones to shore up what it sees as needed future territory . , it 's been that for some for some time . They had one in the Belgod region just to the south . Of course , there was that significant incursion last year into Kharkiv and this one into Sumi which they would call a security zone . And they do present a threat to the Ukrainian forces because what they do of course is stretch them and they also fix Ukrainian forces in place . Forces of course which would be better used elsewhere . So , it is a practice the Russians are using and needless to say , Ben , in the future going forward in the event of negotiations , that land can be used as leverage against other demands the Russians are making . But Frank , what would you say ? What position is Russia in to keep up several of these regions of these buffer zones or all at once ? Does it have the forces to do that ? , look , it 's a very long front . It 's a thousand mile front and I think both sides are very stretched . Both sides are suffering shortages . The Russian case probably material in the Ukrainian case certainly manpower but I think it 's fair to say that the Russians are n't are n't suffering in the manpower on the manpower front or in the drone front and so they can afford as it were to prepare for significant operations this year possibly on several fronts . Summer 's coming and of course that 's good weather . And and what about Ukraine ? What position is it in to continue to hold off the Russians ? , since the start , the Ukrainians have been relying on the mainly on now more on their own devices , but mainly on the moral component . There 's no way I think Ukrainian forces are going to break , but they 're going to be seriously stretched . They do have manpower issues . There are those internal debates going on about mobilization of young men in their early 20s . They 're quite divisive and they indicate a real issue there . But in terms of the position the Ukrainians are in to keep holding the Russians back . They 're in they will continue to do so . But they 'll have to seed land in order to make that happen . And sadly they will keep retreading . They will keep retreating as the summer goes on . That 's just the way it 's going to be . The Russians have too much of a prepundonderance in that for it to be otherwise . And just to put this all into perspective , Ukraine 's president and many American officials , including Secretary of State Marco Rubio , do n't believe Russia is interested in peace and is just buying time with negotiations at the moment . What is Russia 's ultimate goal then ? Nobody knows . You 'd have to ask the presidency that . However , the indications are that at the very least they will want to secure those four provinces or five provinces including Crimea in the south . and for that they 're going to take a lot more time to grind forward in that attritional manner they use and get as far as they can before they run out of steam which may be next year or the year after . Wo n't be this year though . Military analyst Frank Ledwitch there with the analysis . Thank you very much for being on detail here . Thank you , Ben ."
https://youtu.be/tfQjmvavTjs?si=MFgMHLv0q5udGeCd,European Union parliamentarians push to cut Hungary off from all EU funds,DW news,tfQjmvavTjs,"In news just coming in , a cross party group of European lawmakers wants Hungary cut off from all EU funds . The MEPs want to put more pressure on Budapest , claiming the government of Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban has allowed the establishment of kleptocratic and oligarchic structures . The lawmakers say they want to protect the financial interests of European taxpayers . Green MEP Duo Fu initiated the letter and joins us now live from the European Parliament in Brussels . Thank you very much for your time . What practices are our taxes supporting in Hungary ? , unfortunately EU funds are subsidizing the destruction of Hungarian democracy and the rule of law . And we see that ever since Victor Orban is in power , EU funds are enriching his closest friends and family , but they are then also using that money to buy up the last remaining independent news outlets . they are using these resources to stifle any criticism and opposition . What examples do you have of structures being changed of corruption etc . ? , there is a whole list of corruption cases where family members or fed members have stolen from EU projects . It 's it 's it 's at this point quite hard to find EU funded projects where there is not some mismanagement , corruption or at least that the projects were allocated to mayors to areas where people more reliably vote fidest rather than the opposition . so there is so much going on that it 's it 's so blatant and Orban 's friends and family use that money then to take private jets to the Maldes and build palaces and things that . Some funds have already been frozen . What 's that accomplished ? So for two and a half years now there is some funding frozen . So far we have n't seen any reforms . there were 17 milestones reforms agreed between the European Commission and the Hungarian government . To this day not a single one of these reforms has been achieved . Sadly , the commission has unfrozen some of the money because Orban was blackmailing the EU on the Ukraine support and the accession procedure for Ukraine , which led Fondelign to unfreeze 10 of the 27 billion that were frozen at the time . But we say if there are no reforms , if the corruption just continues , then at this point all the funding has to be stopped so that it does n't go to waste and it 's not stolen . What 's the likelihood of that happening ? , if you look at the signatures under this letter , this is very broadly supported from the conservatives , social democrats , liberals , Greens and left in the house . This is a very large majority in the house here that supported this letter and we have shown in the past that the European Parliament does not shy away from using all the tools available to create the necessary pressure on the commission but also on the national government . to really protect our money but also to protect democracy and rule of law in Hungary . So we will fight for this very hard . Could it go even further than this ? Could could we see Hungary thrown out of the block ? there is no mechanism to eject a member state . , and I would not to see that honestly because millions of Hungarians have not voted for Victor Orban and his government . , but they would all suffer from Hungary leaving the EU . We see very strong support in all polls for EU membership in Hungary . And we even see very strong support in Hungary for what we 're doing , not giving EU funds to a government that misuses or steals that funding . So , I would not them to be ejected . But I want maximum pressure on Victor Orban , who is not only stealing our money , but he is also threatening all of our security by constantly putting his veto on Russia sanctions , on supporting Ukraine , and I think that is something that we need to look at as well . I think his veto should be taken away . These are all things that we can do while keeping Hungary in the EU . Intriguing story , Daniel Green . member of the European Parliament , Daniel Fu .

Inspired by Israel 's Iron Dome , the ambitious Golden Dome project will include a massive network of satellites to detect , track , and potentially intercept incoming missiles . Trump said it would be fully operational by the end of his term . He also said it is expected the total investment to reach $ 175 billion . The plan still has to be approved by Congress . Let 's have a listen into what he had to say at the Oval Office while presenting the program . in the campaign , I promised the American people that I would build a cuttingedge missile defense shield to protect our homeland from the threat of foreign missile attack . And that 's what we 're doing today . I am pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for the state - of - the - art system that will deploy next generation technologies across the land , sea , and space including space - based sensors and interceptors and Canada has called us and they want to be a part of it . So , we 'll be talking to them . They want to have protection also . So , as usual , we help Canada . , to shed more light on this , I 'm joined now by security and foreign policy expert Michael O'Hanland with the US think tank the Brookings Institution . Good to see you , Michael . I want to start by asking , does the US really need a bigger , better missile shield ? , the answer is probably . Donald Trump says a lot of things that are half crazy , but the overall argument here is worth taking seriously because , as you probably know , we already have a bit of a national missile defense . It 's based primarily in Alaska and California , designed primarily against a North Korean ICBM threat and now roughly 15 years old . And we 're trying to upgrade that , but it 's not capable against not particularly capable against Iran if they ever develop a nuclear capable missile . It 's not capable against launches from the east in general . And if you 're worried about an accidental launch or a coercive threat with somebody saying we 'll launch one or two missiles at you if you do n't do x y or z. This a system has a certain logic . What does not have a logic is believing you could provide an airtight coverage of the whole country against any and all missile attacks including allout attacks from Russia or China . And if President Trump chases that dream , it may be a little more technologically plausible than under Ronald Reagan 's Star Wars vision , but it 's going to be in excess of trillions of dollars in ultimate expense and still probably not be anywhere near a perfect protection . So , it depends what threat you 're protecting against , but , some a new concept beyond the Alaska California system we have now may be worth a second look . We 're familiar with the Iron Dome as Israel has . What makes it different to the Golden Dome that 's presented here ? , as you well know , our country is far bigger and moreover , the missiles we 're talking about trying to protect against could have nuclear weapons on them . So , a 95 % success rate for the Iron Dome in Israel may not be good enough for a Golden Dome in the United States if what you 're envisioning is all out Russian or Chinese nuclear attack . So that 's the basic difference . The size of the country that has to be protected and the nature of the warhead . You mentioned you can get into an off defense arms race very easily if you 're not careful on this . . You mentioned Golden Dome 's predecessor from the 80s under in the Reagan administration , what became known as Star Wars , I seem to remember . it fell short because of technological overreach and sky - high costs . Has this idea 's time come ? It 's it 's much more plausible to do this against a limited threat if you believe the country you 're dealing with does not have the capacity to just get into an offense defense arms race . The problem with nuclear weapons is that you 've got to be 99.9 % sure you could stop them before you have any real sense that you got the country secure and safe , which means the offense has the inherent advantage . And that 's still true even with today 's technologies . So , if you 're thinking about a North Korea or an Iran or a Vladimir Putin who wants to threaten one nuclear weapon attack for a demonstration , then , today 's technologies are much more capable than Ronald Reagan 's and we could do some interesting things . But if what you 're talking about is denying the Russians or Chinese the ability to threaten the country comprehensively , that 's still going to be in all likelihood a pipe dream . Before we go , Russia and China called the US missile shield plan deeply destabilizing . Could it trigger an arms race ? , China 's already engaged in a pretty nice arms race of its own . It 's building several hundred long range weapons a year . And so , I do n't think we 're the ones that started it . We 've brought down our arsenals by 90 % since the Cold War . And of course , Vladimir Putin 's the one who 's returned the world to great power , not just rivalry , but conflict with his attack on Ukraine and his nuclear threats against NATO from time to time . So , , I 'm not a big fan of this concept in all incarnations , but I 'm not that interested in Beijing and Moscow 's critique . Michael Anhanland , great to get your insight . Thanks so much . Thank you , Kylie ."

The new agreement would see a reduction in routine border checks on animal and plant products traded between the EU and UK that 's aimed at reducing costs and speeding up transit . The two sides have also established a joint defense and security pact that would boost joint military capabilities and coordinate support for Ukraine . The deal also sees a 12 - year extension of a fishing deal granting EU boats access to UK waters . The two sides will also work closer on migration and carbon emissions . And there are plans to allow young people in Britain and the EU to live and work in each other 's territories more easily . , Quentyn Peele might tell us . He 's an associate fellow with the Europe program at Chattam House in London from where he joins us now . Welcome back to DW , Quentin . The deal not completely done yet , but given what we do know of it , do it as significant ? , I think it 's really fundamentally very positive because it is a move to bring the two sides together and talk to each other in a thoroughly civilized manner . So , it 's opening up opening up markets for the British that they had talked themselves out of with Brexit . But most importantly of all , I think is this defense and security partnership , which will bring the two sides together in coordinating the very considerable increase in defense capacity that all Europeans , I think , are trying to build up in the light of the war in Ukraine . And it 'll give the British some access to the money that 's being raised by the rest of the European Union . And and you talk about this being an opportunity for the two sides to talk to each other in what you called a thoroughly civilized manner . That was missing before , was it with between Britain and the European Union ? It was really , , because the former Conservative government , particularly with under Boris Johnson and so on , were seemed to be constantly determined not to negotiate with the European Union as such . They wanted to have all their dealings just bilaterally with individual member states and so they avoided as much as possible doing anything that really provided recognition to the European Union . Now inevitably this deal because it does provide recognition to the European Union has called caused screams of rage from those who were very much in favor of Brexit . They 've been accused of surrender . They 've been accused of betrayal . So I fear that the old divisions over Brexit still linger on . Let 's talk about the opposition because it will seem odd to people who are who are not in Britain that a successful deal with the biggest trading block in the world will be criticized by people within the country . Do do the criticisms as carry any water ? Do they bear any weight ? , they get very well aired throughout the media . A lot of which is in Britain is pro- Brexit and I think there 's a lot of disappointment that Brexit has n't produced many of the advantages that it was supposed to of giving Britain back control of its borders and everything else . So the Conservative Party now in opposition and the Reform Party very passionately in favor of Brexit have both come out very much criticizing particularly the fisheries deal here which is in economic terms very marginal but in political terms is really quite difficult to sell because it will give European Union member states continuing access to British fishing waters . for an extra 12 years ."

The pro - EU mayor of Bucharest , Niko Ashardan , defeated Gaok Simeon , a farright na nationalist rival who modeled his campaign on that of Donald Trump . Dan has vowed to rebuild Romania , which is one of the European Union 's poorest countries . He also promised to maintain support for neighboring Ukraine . Now Alina Bongu Pipidi is professor of political science at the Guido Cari University in Rome . She 's now she joins us from Bucharest . CityW. Tell us more about Nico . What 's he Nico Dan ? What 's he known for ? , Nikico Dan is a nerd . He 's a former Olympics in mathematics and a passionate civic activist who fought for Bucharest against violent development projects which were tearing apart the old structure of the city , the texture u rooting out poor people as well as the historical heritage of the city and this is how he made his reputation . He 's a maniac amateur lawyer who went on behalf of poor people many times in court suing the government and all this helped him get elected as mayor of Bucharest . As mayor of Bucharest , he did n't have a party of his own . So he really struggled without having a majority in the local council but he managed to balance the budget and he was in Bucharest the first completely honest mayor for some generations . that 's and all this positioned him into being a good candidate . that 's that 's that 's quite an accolade . Bucharest 's first honest mayor . , looking at as the country as Romania faces the outside world , how is Mr. Dan 's election likely to affect foreign policy ? , Mr. done came on a wave of continuity to be very honest because Romania wanted to remain in the European Union and in NATO and out of the sudden this very strange coalition formed of an anti - e coalition formed of nostalgics of fascist nostalgics of communism and a core group of antivaccinists got together under a strange label of sovereignists but they were not really sovereignist because they were all running to DC to take a selfie with Mr. Trump and we needed someone to put up front and he was the only plausible candidate since political parties are very dis discredited here after many years of corruption and anti - corruption also which did their fair share of simply ruining traditional political parties and people wanted an independent . So that is how he won and what will change in Romania 's position in the west nothing will change but that is good news because the alternative would have been an ally to Mr. Fitzro in Slovakia and to Victor Orban . That was the counter candidates offer . Now we this the election had to be rerun because of Russian interference . Was there was there evidence of that again in this election ? , the Russian interfer is very old with us and it 's not only in elections , it 's also between elections . The Russia for instance we have evidence that they supported a lot the antivaccine movement . It seems irrational but evidence existing plenty was published by the BBC . They they supported this a lot . They also supported a lot the lawsuits by East European parents against Scandinavian child care agencies which they built into some civil civilizational clash between the west which tries to steal the children from the east . They also support constantly campaigns against Brussels , which may seem ridiculous to us , but which really gather a very large following , Brussels is forcing people to eat insects . In the future , we 're going to have to put insects into everything that we eat . They fight a lot against the Green Deal . They translate the Green Deal into being really damaging to people . And we 're talking people who are in premodern Europe in rural areas deserted by a lot of people who went to the active workforce which went to west . So these are really the remainers people left behind who are very influenced . So it 's not an elections day influence . It 's more a continuous influence which was really very damaging . Thanks for talking us through that professor Alina Amongu PPD from Guido Kali University in Rome . Thank you so much ."
https://youtu.be/DgxjGLO-hW8?si=-JeYvqHvEDsZKSMQ,"EU and UK strike trade, security deal ",DW news,DgxjGLO-hW8,"The United Kingdom has struck a deal with the European Union in the most significant reset of relations since Brexit . European Commission President Walon and European Council President Antonio Kosa announced details of the agreement in London earlier alongside the UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer . The wide - ranging deal includes measures on defense , trade , food , and passport checks . EU and British leaders said the deal signaled a new era in relations . We 're turning a page . We 're opening a new chapter in our unique relationship . This is the story of historical and natural partners standing side by side on the global stage , facing most of the same challenges , pursuing the same objectives , likeminded , sharing the same values . And thus we are looking for solutions that are beneficial for both our people and standing shoulder by shoulder when it comes to really getting to the solutions . Today we have struck this landmark deal with the EU . A new partnership between an independent Britain and our allies in Europe . This is the first UK EU summit . It marks a new era in our relationship and this deal is a win - win . Our UK correspondent Bigot Mas is at that summit in London . Bigot , what are the key takeaways from this deal ? The main takeaway , Nicole , I think , is that this is really a new chapter in the relations . So , it 's really a change in the tone of language . So , not a combative vocabulary that we know from the Brexit negotiations but a much friendlier demeanor and I think you could summarize this . So , after the divorce they are not lovers again but friends . Is it a win - win or is one side gaining more from this agreement than the other ? Both sides have to make compromises and had to make compromises in order to arrive at this deal . The EU was always adamant that they did n't want to offer the UK a bespoke arrangement . They did n't want to set a precedent that if a country leaves the European Union that afterwards it would get preferential treatment . However , this ex seems to be exactly what they are doing with this deal . They 're giving the UK , for example , access to the EU energy markets . They 're stopping some checks at the border , which would be beneficial for UK companies . So there are concessions , clear concessions on the EU side . However , the UK also had to swallow some bitter pills . And I think one of them , that 's one that Brexiteers are complaining most loudly about already , is that they had to accept EU fisheries in their waters for years to come . that 's that 's been something that 's very contentious . And they also have to accept some rules , some EU rules here in the UK without having a seat at the table . and tell us more about the defense and security aspect . So this is a formal defense pack . I think a lot of the details still have to be negotiated and still have to be fleshed out . What we do know is that there are going to be continuous meetings on defense on security and also cooperation on things sanction . Now , what the UK really wants is access to the EU defense fund , a new EU defense fund , and that 's 150 billions euros worth of loans and the UK defense industry is hoping to have access . And this is something where we learned here at the summit , at the press conference that there are negotiations that are ongoing , but this is what Kistama is hoping to be able to secure for the for the British industries . So , how significant is all of this ? Is it really the great postrexit reset in EU British relations that Kirst 's government in particular was aiming for ? , I think it 's definitely a reset . , some of these points seem to be quite technical . There 's not a huge vision behind it an overarching theme we are going to back towards the European Union . There is no there is no talk of the UK joining the single market again , joining the customs union even the government is keeping its red lines but definitely steps towards the European Union and Kama will hope that the benefits of this deal will convince the British people and he 's hoping that in the end it 's going to be beneficial for business and this is what 's going to what he 's hoping what 's going to stick and not the calls of betrayal from the Brexiteers . That was DW 's Burgot Mas . Thank you so much , Burgett ."
https://youtu.be/sf84IDJMORw?si=JCCM783XwVuaokXv,Exit polls say centre-right party wins Portugal vote,DW news,sf84IDJMORw,"Portugal just held its third election in as many years . Now , today 's ballot was called in March after Prime Minister Luis Montenegro failed to win a confidence vote in Parliament , a vote he himself proposed . Now , exit polls suggest his incumbent center- Democratic Alliance received the most votes with centerleft socialists in second place . Support for the far- party Chega appeared to rise to 20 % putting them third . The Portuguese political landscape has become increasingly fragmented in recent years with rising house prices and rents and the steep increase in immigration becoming key issues . NDW 's Yan Philip Schultz has been following the Portuguese general election and joins us now from Lisbon . to you . So , what can you tell us about the latest results in Portugal ? , according to the latest numbers , the Democratic Alliance , the ruling party gets about 36 % of the votes . They are the winners of the evening . The Socialists , the biggest opposition party , are the losers for sure . They only get around 23 % of the votes . as in many other European countries , all eyes have been on the far . the farright party is called Shega , which is means translated something enough . And they are another winner of the evening . They are as strong as the socialists now . well above 20 % , voter turnout has been around 60 % which was more or less predicted . , can you tell us a bit about the key issues that were really on voters minds in this Portuguese election ? , one of the main issues has been irregular migration and the increase in the numbers of irregular migrants . This has certainly contributed to the rise of the farright party as in many other countries as well . Until recently , Portugal was one of the few countries in Europe which did n't have any farright party or at least not any successful farright party . Another very important issue at the moment is political stability . Everyone that I have talked to today here in Portugal mentioned this . Three elections in three years is definitely a negative record . So people want more political stability and the new government definitely has to deliver and can not call for elections after a few months once again . , you mentioned that the incumbent center party appears to have won around 36 % of the votes . So clearly they 're going to have to work together with a coalition partner . What types of coalitions are likely ? I guess the most likely scenario is another minority government led by Luis Montenegro 's Democratic Alliance . in the past years , minority governments have become something quite usual here in Portugal . In the past , during the past government , the socialists have tried to have something a constructive opposition and abstain from critical votes . So , a minority government is probably the only option on the table because a coalition between the two main parties the conservative democratic alliance and the socialists does n't seem very likely . and Luis Montenegro has also ruled out any cooperation with the far . That was DWAN Philip Schultz reporting for us from Lisbon . Thank you so much ."
https://youtu.be/qIcI_lIVJqk?si=VriGF3Rn07kA7PyK,Could this election mark a turning point toward a more united Poland?,DW news,qIcI_lIVJqk,", voting has also ended in the first round of Poland 's presidential election to choose a successor to conservative Andre Duda . Exit polls show that frontr runner Rafael Cheskovski , the liberal mayor of Warsaw , and -wing historian Carroll Nabroski are safely through to a runoff election on June 1st . Foreign policy dominated the campaign , including the war in Ukraine and its consequences for Poland . The post of president there is largely ceremonial , but it does come with a powerful of veto . And DW Brussels bureau chief Alexander Fernammen spent the day in Warsaw covering the presidential election . Alexandra , good to see you . So , what 's the latest you can tell us about the results ? , we have to say that it was a very close race with the front runner in slightly advanced . He is slightly ahead in this first round of the presidential election . However , Mr. Chazkovski , the liberal mayor of Warso , already acknowledged in his speech after the first poll was published that it was a very tight race . His main opponent , the conservative -wing historian Mr. Navroski also addressed his supporters saying that he has a chance to win this race because the race is so close . they will face each other in the second round . And for sure nothing is certain now when we look at the first exit polls and this is very surprising that the race so far has been so close , so tight . And what were the main issues that voters were thinking about when voting today ? , we had a chance to speak with voters here in Warso . Many of them told us that because they live in such dangerous times , they would to see a strong and independent and decisive president here in Poland . One voter told us that he would to see a president who is not blocking all the new legislations that the government is proposing . that is the case or has been the case under the incumbent president . But there are also others here in Warso . Others told us that are very disappointed with what the ruling government , the ruling parties are doing . They think that they are too liberal , that they want to see a stronger , more conservative president in office . So all of that is showing you that there is a deep polarization the Polish society . , you mentioned it after two years of tensions we can call them between the outgoing conservative president Duda and Prime Minister Donald Tusk who was very much reformminded . Could this election somehow mark a turning point ? Could we see a more united Poland come out of this ? , so far the first round of the presidential election is showing us that the country is still very much divided , polarized . Of course , if the candidate of the government Rafael Chazkovski wins the second round , we will have both the prime minister and the president belonging to the same party . So it will make it much easier for the government to live up to the promises that they made when they were elected . They will be able to introduce legislation such as for instance a more liberal abortion legislation . but it does n't mean that they will be supported by the whole nation because this first round of the presidential election has shown us that there are many people in Poland who are not satisfied with what the government and the parties governing Poland are doing . Thank you so much for that Alexander . That was DW 's Brussels bureau chief Alexander from Nammen in Warso forest . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/tycIKD2qvHE?si=z4k4xzA3kBwilkH_,Romania election: Candidates neck-and-neck,DW news,tycIKD2qvHE,"Polls have closed in Romania 's highstakes presidential election with both sides claiming victory . Exit polls show pro - EU Nikosur Dan ahead of his far- nationalist rival George Simeon with more than half the votes counted . In a speech , Dan said Romanian society had shown impressive strength , but he warned that hard economic times lie ahead . Both candidates have already claimed victory . Simeon rejected the exit polls and called on his supporters to not allow electoral fraud . Let 's go over to Bucharest now where our correspondent Anal Bora has been covering these elections . So Anal voting ended just about an hour ago and both sides are already claiming victory . what else are the candidates saying ? , just a short while ago , I spoke to Nikicoan . We 're outside his party headquarters , and he said that the exit polls are giving him a lead . , and , , he 's a mathematician , so he was quite precise . He said , "" We 're still waiting for results , though . "" But on the other side , George Simone has claimed victory . He said that he has won , although official results are not out , not out yet , and exit polls are giving the centrist candidate , , a lead . So this is going to go down the wire . Now it also remains to be seen if either side and most likely the suspicion here is that Mr. Simeon could dispute the election if Nikicoan gets the numbers once all the votes have been counted . And tell us more about the two men who are vying to become Romania 's next president . , Nikosan is very pro Europe , very pro - EU . who in fact behind me there 's a large gathering and people are carrying the flag of the European union and many people we met here told us that they want their country to go in pro- Europe pro- west direction . Mr. Simon on the other hand is very critical of aid to Ukraine . He said that Romania will continue to be a member of the EU and NATO but he 's called his party a Trumpist party . So he 's trying to draw a link an ideological link between his party and the MAGA movement . both candidates have are being seen as in a way independent candidates because there is a large anti - establishment feeling here on the ground . But Mr. Simeone in a way tried to portray himself as a pro - Trump candidate to crush or cancel the message of Nikicoan that if he were chosen then Romania would move in an anti - est direction but so far what we see here that it 's quite a tight race . Now , we should remember that last year 's presidential election was in fact anulled following claims of Russian interference and now we 're hearing again allegations of interference in today 's runoff vote . What can you tell us about that ? , Telegram is a social media app and the owner of Telegram is of Russian origin . and he has he said that there was pressure on him and his company from an unnamed western government . He did not name which government but he said there was pressure on him from a western government to shut down the voices of conservatives in Romania . To which Nikicoan 's party suggested that this in itself is interference . It amounts to interference because in a way it 's trying to rally support behind Georgia Simone . Georgia Simone on his end has said that there are dead people on voting lists and that his party members and his supporters are keeping an eye at on polling booths to check that these dead people do not emerge . So experts that we talking to say that there is concern that if this is if the if the results are very tight by the by the time all votes are in then the election could be disputed and these claims are coming in to suggest that there is fraud .

https://youtu.be/eMoPSY415uo?si=lACFlzRuVwE3dzqQ,Why a Mexican Navy ship crashed into Brooklyn Bridge ,DW news,eMoPSY415uo,"Authorities in New York say at least two people have been killed after a Mexican Navy ship collided with a landmark Brooklyn Bridge . Around 20 others have been injured . The training ship was departing the city when it struck the bridge , snapping its three masts . A beautiful scene on the East River in New York City , quickly turning into a disaster . [ Applause ] New Yorkers film the panic on the bank as the ship drifts towards the shore after the collision . We got to keep moving . This is insane . As rescue crews rush to the scene , eyewitnesses look on in disbelief as the vessel finally stops . We were saying goodbye to all the guys who were leaving . The ship had already departed . A few seconds after it left the dock where it was , we suddenly saw all the lights , how they collided , hit the bridge , and they all fell underneath . US authorities believe the Mexican Navy 's training ship lost power before colliding with the Brooklyn Bridge . Nearly 280 people were on board the Kua Tok . We have one more injured passenger that wants to be transported to Pier 16 . the captain that was maneuvering the ship lost I guess power of the ship and the current mechanical function caused the ship to go into the pillar of the bridge hitting the mass of the ship where there was couple of sailors on top of it . these sailors were injured . The ship was sailing through New York City as part of its goodwill journey . Each year it sets sail to mark the end of classes at the naval military school . The Mexican Navy says it left the port of Aapulka on the 6th of April . It was supposed to visit 22 ports in 15 nations with the final destination in Iceland . But its journey has come to a sudden unexpected end . , let 's get more on that now with Dr. Sebastian Brunes , a senior researcher in the department for maritime strategy and security at Kil University . Good to have you with us . so first of all this is a very busy waterway there . how can an accident this happen ? from what we know now it seems that the ship lost its auxiliary power which means despite the fact that it 's obviously a sail ship it has an engine . and that engine appears to have failed as the ship departed its birthing with a tug line to the ship . but apparently that tug line did not hold the ship as it drifted up towards the East River and in these difficult conditions , these difficult tides and the strong currents that are that are a landmark of that part of New York City . is there nothing no mechanism to prevent that ? because the way you just explained it , it sounds to a layman myself that this could happen any time . , it certainly is n't the first time that these things or issues that have been have been happening in the maritime sphere . there are some opportunities , some options if one loses auxiliary power . the captain for instance could try to put out an anchor and try to stop the ship from drifting . or there could be other tugs in the area that quickly attach to the ship and try to keep it from drifting . However , accidents that do happen . they , , the maritime domain , the marit the seas sailing is a difficult a dangerous business in the first place and , these things happen at a at a relatively quick speed as well . and so the reaction time was apparently much too slow or not enough reaction time to keep the ship from hitting the bridge . And and perhaps just to clarify because that sailing ship was departing New York , it got into the harbor safely at first , but coming out it also looked the bridge was simply too low . That is correct . That is correct . the ship pulled into Manhattan 's South Street Sea Seaport for a for a visit to the New York City as part of the naval diplomacy cooperation agreements that Mexican and the United States have . And as it was departing , it was due to go south . but instead , because it lost the engine power very quickly , perhaps after the lines were cast , and the ship was coming a drift , the ship moved upwards the East River . despite its name , this is not a river . this is a saltwater straight , which means it connects two there 's no fresh water in it . It connects two bodies of seawater . And again there can be very high current . So absolutely instead of going down single it went north . Sebastian Brun from K University thank you so much for your insights ."

The blast caused extensive damage to the facility and blew out doors and windows in nearby buildings . Police say it was a deliberate act of violence and the US Attorney General has called the attack unforgivable . No group has admitted carrying out the bombing at this stage . , for more on the story , let 's go to DW reporter Stefan Simons in Washington DC . Stephan , good to see you . , what more do we know at this point ? , I can tell you that the FBI and the ATF , Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms Agency are on the scene . And this is an FBI investigation , of course , helped by local authorities and law enforcement assets , too . And why is that ? because the FBI is working under the presumption that this is a intentional and an act of terrorism not just violence but terrorism . Now is there what we know so far a suspect ? . But there is a person of interest apparently and there has been identified in address a house a location where law enforcement assets are getting assets are getting ready or have been getting ready to maybe perform a raid or some investigation . Now what happened there ? this bomb explosion was quite significant as authorities say quite powerful . So that had really a punch . it had one person dead , four per people injured . we do n't know the identity yet of the person deceased , nor of the four people who got in some to some degree severely injured . and the American Reproductive Centers , Palm Springs , that 's the fertility facility where this explosion happened , said that nobody of their staff nor the assets , that means eggs , embryos , reproductive materials were harmed or damaged . Stephan , there 's still a lot we do n't know . It is still very early clearly , but are there any hints or clues as to the big question regarding a possible motivation for this attack ? , everybody 's scratching their heads and everybody 's asking exactly what you just asked . What 's the motive ? Who could have an interest and what is behind this ? There are no answers . , , FBI local authorities , local law enforcement as well as ATF . They were asked , "" Have they is there any clue ? Do they know anything ? "" , but they were n't really force coming and said , "" , they really struggling with what the motive was here . "" We had attacks in the past in this country on abortion clinics , but fertility facilities , , at least to me , and I 've been around here a while , it 's a complete new one . No motive yet .

At a meeting with business leaders in Qatar 's capital , Doha , Trump said his Gulf trip could raise up to $ 4 trillion in deals . Trump also spoke to US troops at the Qatar Air Base , previously used by the US military to carry out missions in Iraq and Afghanistan . Trump said he would never hesitate to use force to defend the US and its partners . For more , we can now talk to Ricardo Alcaro . He is an analyst at Italy 's Institute for International Affairs . He joins us from Rome . Tell us , what is your assessment of President Trump 's visit to the Gulf States so far ? What does it tell us about US foreign policy ? look I think there are at least two things that are really striking in this trip . even knowing Trump even knowing what his worldview is it is striking to see that worldview put it put in put into put in place put in into reality . The trip has been characterized by these two themes . one business over geopolitics . Although geopolitics was part of it , business was the main driver . This was about making deals with countries that have massive cashes of flow flows of cashes that they 're available and they and who have expressed the intention to use those c use that cash to support American companies or to make deals with American companies . And the second trend that is also very interesting is to see how Trump has this tendency to very much making the border between personal relations and institutional relations very much blurred . So you do n't know where the relationship between the United States as a country with these Arab Gulf countries starts and the relationship between Trump and his families with the dynasties in power in the Arab in the Arab Gulf states starts . What about the , that 's the business side you 've talked about though . what about the geopolitics of this ? This is this really just purely about Trump a business trip for Trump and his family or is there really a g will there be some geopolitical changes coming about as a result of this ? It is mostly about business but geopolitics a function of that because the corollary policy of an approach which is businessoriented is that geopolitical tensions should be should be should be contained and deescalation should be given priority over conflict and escalation . And this is extremely this fits perfectly the landscape in the Gulf because there is a simmering conflict with Iran over Iran 's long - standing nuclear ambitions which Trump has tried to contain and deescalate by starting negotiations with Iranians over the nuclear program . a negotiation which just a few months ago did n't look very much likely and now is starting to take shape and look more promising than most people feared . Not least because the countries in the Arab the Arab countries governments contrary to what was the case 10 years ago when Obama struck his own nuclear deal with Iran are now in favor of the deal . So there is a convergence of views between the Saudis , the Emiratis , the Qataris , the Omanis and Trump towards finding some solution compromise with Iran over its nuclear program . But this is not yet a given alone . that the words that the path to the deal is still is still . if you 're still with us Ricardo also to add the decision by Trump to lift sanctions on Syria and re - engage Syria which is again something the Arab G states wanted and which Trump sees as advantageous to the United States . something that other presidents would not have favored that easily because they would have gone first through a consultation process with Israel which is being sidelineed in this trip and this is also quite the novelty . Ricardo , thank you very much for speaking with us . That was Ricardo Alcaro . He 's an analyst with the think tank , the Italian think tank , the intern Institute of International Affairs ."
https://youtu.be/jDM_8g_70kk?si=IG5z5OucoR_A5Pig,Putin not on list for ceasefire talks with Zelenskyy in Turkey,DW news,jDM_8g_70kk,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is not on a list of delegates set to attend talks in Turkey aimed at ending the war in Ukraine . Ukrainian President Womir Zilinski had urged Putin to attend in person for a first fa face - to - face meeting since the 2022 Russian invasion . Zalinski is traveling to Ankura according to officials in Kiev . Now , while US President Donald Trump 's presence is also unlikely , Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Ankura ahead of the negotiations . Kiev has called for sanctions to be imposed on Russia if Putin does n't participate in the talks . Before the list was published , Silinsky said he would decide how to be involved in the talks based on who Russia would be sending . Today , we had several meetings with the team regarding the format in Turkey . I am waiting to see who will arrive from Russia . Then I 'll decide what steps Ukraine should take . The signals from the media are not yet convincing . Let 's go to Washington DC and talk to our correspondent Benjamin Alvarez Gruber . So has the Trump administration responded to this yet ? So what we 're hearing from the Trump administration is what an US official said that President Trump would no longer join this Russia Ukraine peace talks in Turkey is something that was said after the Kremlin announced the Russia delegation that would attend these talks . A list that as you just said did not include Russian President Putin . Trump is currently on a trip to Saudi Arabia , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . he had afflated this possibility of joining the meeting himself if Putin did so . That 's also what we 've heard from the special envoy of the White House , Keith Khal . But what we 've heard from the press pool traveling with the president is that this topic and how to end the war in Ukraine was among the top topics he discussed during multiple meetings in the region . President Trump also was asked about that and he once again praised Secretary of State Marie who already landed in Turkey to take part in these very crucial conversations . Now some Republicans in Washington , those not some of them aligned with Trump but others who are not , they 've been calling for a much tougher stance toward Russia even since the beginning . could this turn US public opinion further against Putin that he 's not going to be attending these talks ? There is definitely a lot of growing criticism on President Trump , accusing him of being too reluctant to pressure Putin . Many are claiming that he 's consignantly consistently signaling his readiness to offer Russia concessions while adopting a noticeably tougher stance on Ukraine . And now of course that we have this close ally of President Trump , Senator Lindsey Graham forging or going ahead with this plan to impose new sanctions on Russia . Steep tariffs also on those countries who are buying Russian oil , Russian gas , it gets harder and harder for the US president who has been struggling to fulfill his campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine as soon as possible . And that 's because Trump had been telling a story before this that it was Zilinski who was reluctant to negotiate a peace with Putin . That it was Zilinski that did n't want to meet Putin and bring this war to an end . That seems to be shifting a little bit . Trump at that point had said that he was going to walk away from negotiations if Kiev did n't join them . could this be a turning point here ? Could this be grounds for him to Trump for Trump to walk away from these talks because of Putin not wanting to join ? So we have seen a shift already if we compare how the first talk with Ukrainian President Silinski went in the oval office in this shouting march and how the next talk on the sidelines of the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome went . But President Trump has threatened to walk away from these talks I if there was no success or if he found that there was no way of founding common ground between both sides between Ukraine and also between Russia and Silinski has been pressuring and hoping also that the current period of diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine will end with President Trump understanding that it 's Vladimir Putin that is the real obstacle to peace . That 's what Silinski has been talking and telling people over and over . And Silinsky also said that he would travel to Turkey whether or not Putin flew in for talks . So this might be an additional point of inflection for the US president that might lead to an even tougher stance with Russian President Vladimir Putin . Benjamin Alvarez Gruber in Washington . Thanks as always ."
https://youtu.be/NXhpgD9AMRo?si=cAtTDh0iPjPYCFxP,Zelenskyy expects Russian President Putin to be at talks in Turkey. Who will show up?,DW news,NXhpgD9AMRo,"Let 's talk now to Doitilia Samaramoso , an expert on Russian foreign and security policy at King 's College , London . . Now , the Kremlin has confirmed that a Russian delegation will be in Istanbul on Thursday for possible direct talks with Ukraine . What do you think Russia wants to achieve with these talks ? I think on the immediate front what Russia wants to make sure is to send a message to Donald Trump that they are ready to engage in talks that they are not against peaceful negotiations and that they 're not the wrong party in these efforts at reaching a peaceful settlement of the of the war . but of course more deeply what Russia wants to achieve is certain key strategic objectives which is which it has defined from the start of the war namely to ensure for example that Russia is allowed to keep the territories that it currently occupies including a recognition of Crimea as Russian territory . Of course , as was mentioned several times , the desire to change the regime in Kiev and replace Zilinski with someone who is more aminable to reaching an agreement . There 's also a desire to ensure that there is some demilitarization of Ukraine and that Ukraine remains neutral and not a member of NATO . But these are very maximalist positions . So it 's very hard to imagine how any negotiations on this front can make progress . what Russia also is trying to make sure is that there is n't a ceasefire unconditionally being implemented and negotiations then following which could delay themselves because this is the Ukrainian plan which is supported by Europe and to a certain extent by the United States . idea to introduce a ceasefire first and then start the negotiations but Russia thinks that it is in a in on the ground that it has the initiative in terms of advancing on the ground in Ukraine . So any freezing of the situation on the ground is seen as giving the advantage to Kiev . So for obvious reasons they are trying to avoid that . however they 're also suffering massively in terms of casualties . So it 's not clear how long they can continue with this war . I think that we need to take that into account as well . Meanwhile , European Union countries have agreed to a 17th package of sanctions against Russia . Is Putin feeling the pressure given measures these ? . in a way Russia has managed to bypass many of these sanctions with as we know this ghost tanker fleet where sanctions have now been additionally imposed by the European Union and in a way it has managed to find markets for its main energy products in China and in India among others . but of course any additional pressure is problematic for the Kremlin and this explains why in all the negotiations Russia is trying to lift the sanctions and if we recall the efforts that were carried out last month there seemed to be a readiness by the United States to slowly start lifting the sanctions . but this is really not very promising because this is a pressure that the west can exert on Russia . But the problem with sanctions is that they do n't always have an immediate effect . they have an effect sometimes long term and the expectation is that the economy may really run out of steam and that there is real pressure . I think that we have to wait and see how effective the implementation of these sanctions are and what we used to call or we call secondary sanctions . That means the countries that are not directly affected but are purchasing Russian energy . And I think there is a package now being discussed by the French foreign minister apparently with the senator American senator Lindsey Graham of introducing very significant sanctions . I think it 's 500 % tariffs on countries that are purchasing Russian oil . But this is really hard to implement . Also , if we think China is one of the biggest countries buying India as well and we 've just seen the challenges of implementing these sanctions more generally and that would also apply to energy to the energy sector . So I think the implementation is the problem sometimes with these initiatives . We 'll have to leave it there for the moment . Dom Sarah Moso , thanks so much for joining us today . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/kUruZ4eAmZI?si=dzalS6yp-xRDVU-q,Will the new EU sanctions on Russia be more effective than previous rounds? ,DW news,kUruZ4eAmZI,"The European Union has just approved a fresh round of sanctions against Russia . This is its 17th round of sanctions since Moscow 's full - scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 . The focus this time is on Russia 's so - called shadow fleet . Now , this tanker , you can see the Aventin is believed to be part of Moscow 's efforts to evade sanctions , including oil price caps . The ship was discovered a drift off Germany 's Baltic coast earlier this year on its way to Egypt . It was carrying oil worth € 40 million . The ships are often uninsured with murky ownership and they are considered a security threat as well as an environmental hazard . Let 's get more on this from DW correspondent Christine Munda in Brussels . Christine , do we know how these vessels are currently able to evade oil price caps ? So Anya , these ships these vessels have been identified as engaging in this shady practice where they will transmit false data . They are known to turn off their transponders so as to become invisible and then engage in this activity known as shipto- ship transfer out at sea . That is they transfer the barrels they have on board to other ships . And the idea here is to conceal the real origin , the true origin of these barrels which are assumed to be Russian oil . And the reason for this is Russian oil is currently capped at $ 60 per barrel . And so if Russia is able to avoid people knowing that the oil that it 's selling out into the world is coming from Russia , then it can effectively earn more . and the idea really is to clamp down on these ships . and the EU has now targeted 200 others . 150 other ships are current have currently been blacklisted . The idea is to restrict the activities of these vessels so that you can limit how much Russia is able to evade this price cap and get more revenues to finance its war in Ukraine . So that is the idea of what the EU is trying to do with this latest round of targeting these 200 vessels . And Christine , in terms of sanctions , , is this a significant step or would you say it is more symbolic ? Anna , this is not the strongest package of sanctions that the European Union has put forward to date , certainly when compared to previous packages . But such is the case now where it is becoming more difficult for the European Union to agree on what to target where you can get that unanimity . And I 'm not just talking about the Hungarian veto that we 've been reporting so much about where Hungary has been blocking a number of the intended measures . but you 're getting a sense now that the bigger that the EU wants to go , the bigger the potential of backlash on EU member states . So take for example the issue of frozen assets , ? There are some member states who say confiscate those assets . That would be a real big blow . But then of course the repercussions of that are feared by member states Belgium who are opposed to that . So the sense is that it is getting more difficult to agree to these measures on the part of the European Union . But this is by no means symbolic in the sense that if you 're able to clamp down on Russia being able to evade the measures that are in place , then these measures will have the intended effect that they will be devastating and somehow limit Russia 's ability to be able to continue its aggression . And Christine , does any of this connect to the to the possible meeting we might be seeing in Turkey between Ukrainian President Zalinski and Russia 's Vladimir Putin ? Certainly , Anna , , for on the part of the European Union , the pressure has been on Moscow to agree to a 30 - day land , air , and sea ceasefire to make way for talks about territory and security guarantees for Ukraine . in the lack of progress on the diplomatic front , there have been growing calls within the European Union that more pressure needs to be put on Moscow . So , you 've heard Berlin , Paris , and a number of other capitals saying we need to tighten the measures . We need to send a signal that we 're willing to go further with these sanctions so as to force the Russians to come to the negotiating table . All of that would be aimed at , for example , persuading or convincing the Russian president to be present for those talks that are intended to be held in Turkey in the in the coming days . So , this is where the European Union is now , trying to force Russia 's hand into agreeing to some a ceasefire so that talks can resume essentially to reach some a diplomatic end to this . In the absence of that , the EU feels it needs to be upping the ante in terms of these restrictive sanctions and other measures . Christine Mundo reporting from Brussels . Christine , thank you ."

What happens after?,DW news,QC2mr4Qj6p8,"Now , the temporary 90 - day truce in the US China trade war comes into effect today with both sides drastically cutting sky - high tariffs . The trade dispute between the world 's two largest economies saw levies for both sides at well over 100 % that hammered global markets with billions of dollars wiped off equities as well as hitting global supply chains . In joint talks in Geneva at the weekend , the US agreed to lower tariffs on Chinese goods to 30 % . China meanwhile agreed to cut its own levies on US goods to 10 % . 11th of May . All , let 's cross to Taipei now and speak to DW 's East Asia correspondent Melissa Chan . Melissa , what 's the mood there amongst businesses now ? businesses in China and also across the region are of course relieved and we 've also seen that reflected in the stock markets here and also in the United States . But one thing that is very clear is that they do understand that this is just for 90 days and no one is absolutely certain what is going to happen after the 90 days are up . , people understand here that the US president Donald Trump has the attention span of a gnat . depending on who he talks to on the 90th day , on the 91st day , he could change his mind in terms of the policy that he wants moving forward and the negotiation that he wants to have with China . One thing that I think is very clear , no matter what happens moving forward , it 's going to be impossible to wave that magic wand and hope for a relationship in the past in terms of the US and China relationship that can never go back . It has been irrevocably broken in the same way that Trump managed to do that during his first term . And the question is what is the new normal and how long it will take to get there , ? the importance of the relationship regardless of the damage as you 're saying that has been done just remind us how important China is as a trading partner for the US and vice versa . these two countries are so tightly linked with China exporting the most to the United States and the United States also exporting so much to China and it 's been mutually beneficial in many ways over the last two decades three decades with of course American consumers benefiting for from inexpensive goods that they can purchase and also China facing o with a population of over a billion people needing to put those people to work factory work is not great but it is better than unemployment . And of course , what we 're seeing now is both countries facing domestic challenges and also looking at the geopolitics where the geopolitics and their national security interests are no longer aligning with their trade relationship and that dynamic is just not going to change moving forward . You mentioned Melissa that people are aware this is for 90 days . Who knows what might happen after that ? , are we likely to see further es deescalation , do you think , during this period , or do you really think or do people think that we might see round two of the trade war after the 90 days are up ? , that 's the million - dollar question . You can say it 's the billion dollar question or the trillion dollar question because of its impact on global trade . And the challenge now is not just companies in the United States and China , but everywhere . Companies ca n't make decisions . past 90 days . They are going day by day , which means that they 're not there are a lot of hiring freezes . I 'm sure we 've all read a lot of headlines about hiring freezes , but also their inability to invest medium and long - term in R&D. And when companies are not sure of what 's going to happen , they are less risky . And risk can be bad , but risk is also potential for economic reward . And so how much innovation is the United States and China losing as a result . How much innovation is being lost globally ? That is a number that you ca n't come up with and it is a loss for not just the United States and China but also the world . Melissa , thank you so much for that . That 's DW correspondent in Taipei , Melissa Chan ."

Plenty of nature , vast salt flats , and normally , not much in the way of culture . But here , in this small harbor , locals are about to enjoy an evening at the opera ! The venue was brought here by truck . An opera house on wheels , so to speak . Here we go ! Fabrice Gervaise is responsible for the assembly . His allotted time : a day and a half . His every move : well - rehearsed . The mobile opera house seats about a hundred . Normally , this stage is used for magic shows . This performance is quite different , and special . When they told me : "" We 're going to do something really crazy , we 're going to bring opera into the villages , "" I was immediately on board . It 's a mad idea ! The project was initiated by the Lyon Opera , which wanted to bring soaring arias to the suburbs and towns of the region . After all , its inhabitants have as much a to culture as anyone . The project is publicly funded , and admission is free . We want people to come to us because they want to be part of something extraordinary . As in : "" What 's going on here in my city , in my neighborhood ? Should I check it out ? "" To do this , we must tear down obstacles separating contemporary art from the public . And this needs to be done for all social classes . Lyon Opera commissioned a piece specifically for this tour : "" Le Sang du glacier – The Blood of the Glacier . "" A big cultural experience , in a small setting , featuring three musicians and two singers . There is not a bad seat in the house . The theater is quite tiny . The idea is to bring the opera as close to the people as possible . The singer sits in the front row for the entire performance , directly in front of the audience . For many people , it 's quite touching and powerful . I try to sing the text as clearly as possible , because the audience is not used to watching opera . Especially not contemporary opera . It 's a chamber opera , without a conductor , and that makes it challenging . We have to take cues from each other , because there 's no one to set the tempo . It 's a very intimate atmosphere . The audience is very close . Experiencing opera up close leaves quite an impression on the audience . This was the first time I ’d seen an opera . It was great . You could really hear the emotion in their voices . The stage design was pretty good . There were some good ideas . And the theater on wheels - it ’s really great ! Many people from Port Saint - Louis have never been to the opera . After all , we ’re a bit isolated here , living between the Camargue and the Rhône Delta . It ’s a unique opportunity nobody should miss . The curtain may have fallen , but Fabrice Gervaise still has work to do . All the effort is worth it when people come out pleased , have had a nice evening , and say : "" See you tomorrow , we 'll be back . That was great ! "" That 's what 's great about this job . After five performances , the troupe packs up and moves on to the next town , continuing its mission to awaken people 's love of opera in new places ."

What more can you tell us ? , that 's . the prosecutors here in Germany say they 've arrested three Ukrainian nationals . two of whom they arrested here in Germany and one was arrested by authorities in Switzerland . And what they accuse these Ukrainian men who are only known under German law as Vladeslav Taniel Bhen B. they say that they have been in touch with agents of the Russian state and that they had admitted their willingness to send explosive items to Ukrainian and Ukraine using freight transportation . And they say that this was a plot that was underway for some time that there had been preparation carried out . There were two test parcels that had been sent with which had been packed with GPS trackers . and they say that this amounts to an act of potential act of sabotage that they have essentially foiled . And now none of this really comes as a great shock to those of us in Germany because this is not the first case of this kind . there was a similar plot that was foiled involving air transportation freight transportation in here in eastern Germany in Leipzig that was allegedly planned by Russian state actors and the security services here in Germany have warned of this time and time again of this rising threat of hybrid warfare which they say has grown sharply since 2022 since that Russian invasion of Ukraine . and they say that since then there have been that the threshold really for Russia 's willingness to carry out such hybrid warfare has fallen and therefore these three individuals have been arrested and they are now in detention and we await to find more details on this story .

https://youtu.be/OwwRBHRYCT4?si=AnSb4SxyUUj4hXam,Trump's Middle East trip: What do the US and Saudi Arabia seek from each other,DW news,OwwRBHRYCT4,"US President Donald Trump is in Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East trip aimed at boosting US business abroad . Earlier on Tuesday , the White House said it had concluded a record - breaking weapons deal with Riad . The deal worth some $ 142 billion will provide Riad with what the White House calls state - of - the - art warfighting equipment . The Trump administration is calling it the largest arm sale deal in US history . It was one of several agreements signed by the US president as he met with Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salma . And to talk more about this , I 'm joined now by William Wexler , senior d senior director of the Rafikeri Center and Middle East programs at the Atlantic Council . Thanks for joining us . Thank you for having me . So this is being called a revival of the US Saudi relationship . , can you walk us through what has changed , what has shifted here since Joe Biden left the White House ? , President Trump is a known commodity to the leaders in Riad , especially to Muhammad bin Salman himself . he 's somebody that they enjoyed working with in his first term in office where they had challenges with President Joe Biden who remember came into office declaring his intent to make Saudi Arabia and Muhammad bin Salman himself a pariah . Although US Saudi relations improved from that point quite significantly during the Biden administration , Trump 's re - election was met with great joy in Riad and frankly in much of the rest of the Gulf as well . Saudi Arabia is a key player in the Middle East , especially when it comes to Israel . Now , Trump said that he hoped Saudi Arabia would join the so - called Abraham Accords . that 's the accords of Arab nations that have agreements with Israel . Do this happening during Trump 's presidency ? It 's a real possibility of it happening during Trump 's presidency . It 's something that Trump very much wants to see happen . Trump did in his own statement recognize that Saudi Arabia will take its own time to do that . and the current the continuing war in Gaza is something that has put a pause on many of those efforts . , the Biden administration in their efforts to significantly improve relationships with Saudi Arabia came very close to a normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that would have involved a lot more defense cooperation and cooperation on other part other subjects with the United States as well . that ended on October 7th , 2023 , but the deal is ready to be picked up again whenever circumstances allow . And so with time , the hope is that circumstances will once again allow for that to happen because it makes too much geopolitical sense for Saudi Arabia , for Israel , and frankly for the entire region . So what you 're saying is that Saudi Arabia might shift its perspective here that until the Gaza situation until Israel stops bombing Gaza then there will be no accords . It is unlikely to happen in the near term , but because of the war in Gaza and given the war and given the realities of that war , frankly , the price of normalization has gone up on both sides . On Saudi Arabia , which might have previously been willing to accept just a mere pathway to a Palestinian state , now there are many voices in Saudi Arabia that says , they need to see much more concrete direction towards a Palestinian state . and also in Israel where many people in Israel are in no mood to reward the Palestinians after October 7th with a state . So time will be the most important factor in getting to a point when those conversations can continue . And Trump has also said that he wants to strike a deal with Iran over nuclear power , their nuclear program . this is at the same time that he 's saying Saudi Arabia is one of the US 's closest allies . can he do both things at the same time ? He can because in this case he 's very much aligned with where Saudi Arabia is . Saudi Arabia is in a different place than it was when the JCPOA when President Obama 's nuclear deal was first signed . Iran is at a is in a weaker position . and Saudi Arabia is much more focused on its economic objectives in vision 2030 of totally reforming its entire economic and social systems . In order to do that in such a short amount of time , they need there to be peace . They need deescalation in the region and that so what Trump is trying to do is very much aligned with what Muhammad Solomon wants to do in that in that respect . . William Wexler , senior director of the Rafa Kheri Center and Middle East programs at the Atlanta Council . Thank you . Thank you very much for having me ."

That was after losing his battle with cancer . Muika , widely known as Pepe , was the president of Uruguay between 2010 and 2015 . He transformed the country through progressive social reforms . Mika was known for his humble lifestyle . He gave up the presidential palace to live on a farm , donated most of his salary , and drove an old Volkswagen Beetle . illegalized same - sex marriage and marijuana . And for more , I 'm joined now by journalist GMO Garat in Monte Vido . Thanks for being with us . Thank you . So , tell us more about Muika 's life . He started off as a Gera fighter to become then later become president . how did he make this transformation ? , it 's a really interesting transformation that began in the in the past century . Mhika gets involved in politics in the 1950s with another political movement . But in the 60s with all this wave of revolutionary left in Latin America , he joined he was a leader of the Garisha of the Tupamaros Garisha which was a Garisha defeated in the 70s by a military coupe in Uruai . When Uruguay regained democracy in 1985 , Muika start to build this new movement , a new movement , a democratic movement . H and he start gaining a lot of popularity in the ' 9s where he was selected as a representative in the Congress . Then he was elected as senator and when the left the broad friend coalition of movements in the left bea came to power in 2005 . He was a minister of agriculture and that was one of his main precupations all these years to give to Uruguay a new say footprint in the in the global market for stock for agriculture and at that time he was a global figure he when he became president in 2010 he start to became a global figure which was and still is something really different in Uruguay because as a as a country in the south a really tiny country with 3 million inhabitant Moika was a figure that let 's say it was an ambassador for the image of the of the country his image was really pronounced this way of holding himself the fact that he lived a poor Uruguayan rather than the president of the country . but a lot of his critics at home often say that he charmed the world with his humble lifestyle but that Uruguay did n't benefit from his presidency . So what do you think all in all will be the legacy of Moika in Uruguay ? there are different impacts in Moika 's let 's say legacy in the in the country . I could say some things in a few seconds , but for example , during Muika 's term , Uruguay became in terms of inequality the lowest country in Latin America with inequality . also for example , under his administration , Urway became the second largest renewable electricity producer after Denmark . he also I think he ruled for the people and he made several progresses for example in poverty . H as you mentioned he donor a considerable part of his salary for building houses but also he settled a way of doing politics a way of doing a political dialogue with for example opponents and which was not a custom here and I think that the legacy is also a culture of political dialogue a political dialogue in these days . . Journalist GMO Garat in Monte Vido , many thanks for your insights . Thank you ."

She 's a senior fellow with the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . It 's good to have you back on the program . What do you make of Donald Trump 's announcement ? I think it 's finally the historic statement and peace offering that we 've been waiting for to meet this historic moment of the fall of the of the House of Assad . there have been many that have been clamoring for removing sanctions at the very least in order to assist Syria with rebuilding the country and really remove barriers so that it can work with all actors and not just other sanctioned players Russia and Iran . And for Syrians , how much of a pivotal turning point will this be ? That 's what the Syrian foreign minister said today . . , , I think the devil will be in the details . , this was a public a very public announcement in Riad . , so that alone , I think , provides some tacet approval for Gulf countries that have wanted to invest in Syria , but have been worried about the US reaction to any investment . So , that 's the first thing we 'll see . But there 's really multiple layers of sanctions and terrorism designations on Syria going all the way back to 1979 . So this wo n't be an immediate lifting of all sanctions . It will take time . We still have n't heard what this portends for , for example , the foreign terrorism designation , the specially designated terrorist designation , the state sponsor of terrorism designation . There 's quite a few that need to be untangled and unraveled and that does n't even go for the UN Security Council sanctions on HTS and Ashetta . So quite a few steps need to be taken . but this is a very positive move and great to see that it was done so publicly in Riyad and a stronger or a recovering Syria . What will that mean for the greater region ? this will be beneficial all around . countries Lebanon and Jordan and others will be able to trade with Syria , move through Syria . So this could potentially be a boon to their economies as well . if we see more investment , we could see more returns , refugee returns to Syria as well . , so this can only be beneficial , I think , because if we had a sanctioned Syria for years on end , we could see a return to nefarious activities that the Assad regime was implicated in the captagon trade , , drug trafficking and other things in order to evade sanctions . So , so this is a really positive development for the region overall . There there 's a lot of talk about Donald Trump being the transactional US president . , in view of that , what will Trump get for lifting these sanctions ? , I think it was President Trump 's inclination to engage with the Syrian government and meet this historic opportunity . You have a government in Damascus for the first time in many years that is hostile to dealing with Iran . so there 's that there 's that moment as well . But I think it 's of no surprise that this is coming from Riad where we 've seen billions of dollars of deals that Trump has announced as well in addition to I think other deals that will be announced in the UAE in the next few days . so I think that there 's a lot to be gained all around but it was great to see that Crown Prince MBS had seemingly pushed this forward and seems to be very much on board with this with this statement . Natasha Hall as always we appreciate your time and your insights tonight . Thank you . Thank you ."

The American celebrity told the court that she feared she would die as millions of dollars worth of jewelry were stolen from her hotel room . Kardashian said she forgave the main defendant who 's admitted to tying her up during the theft . The suspects now mostly in their 60s and 70s are known in France as the Grandpa robbers . All . And Elizabeth Moute is a French journalist and columnist . She joins us from Paris . Good to see you . And Elizabeth . So the Grandpa Roberts , quite a story , just a title in itself . What were the key moments or revelations from Kardashian 's testimony that stood out to you today ? I think what really was striking was how poised she was and how unlike the circus that people had expected , how articulate she was , she was very emotional at some moments because she recalled being woken when she was in her bed at 1:00 a.m. alone in her suite in the center of Paris and there was noise and these men walked in with guns and they dragged her from the bed . They tied her up . They threw her again on the bed . They taped a masking tape on her mouth and she said , "" I thought I was going to die . "" I told them , "" Take anything you want . I have children . "" and it was something 15 12 to 15 minutes . but it was she had a gun to the nape of her neck for a part of that time and it was very striking and very obvious that she 'd gone through a harrowing experience and she said I 've decided to come to Paris to testify as I wanted to clear this up . but the trauma will live with me . My life will be entirely different . Ever since this happened to me I do not go outside . my children have bodyguards . I my jewels are never in my house . Every evening if I 've been wearing them , they go back to the bank with an armed guard and it 's changed my life . , it 's reality TV becoming real . what 's been the reaction in France to this ? , is this being treated as a serious legal story or more of a , , celebrity event ? . And that is also because she talked about herself a little bit . As , she 's now at university taking law courses . She wants to become a lawyer . Her father was a lawyer who was famous or inf famous because he was one of the lawyers for OJ Simpson . but she also talked about the fact that she has been involved with prisoners trying for prisoners rights . And that was interesting because the u the chief judge read out a letter that she had never received from one of the guilty men who was already on remand in jail and he said I 've heard you on American television talking about what a what a shock and how harrowing it was for you and I would to apologize to you and this is a man who 's now 70 over 70 and she said look I have worked with prisoners and I forgive you I will not forget the trauma because I ca n't And all of this was very dignified and absolutely not the circus that we expected . , it speaks to her humanity , that 's for sure . Given Kardashian 's wealth and fame , it seems remarkable that people could get into her hotel room . , has this case had has it had any broader implications on security in Paris ? The hotel is a very strange place . It 's a super luxurious sweets apartment in a building behind the church of llamaden in central terrace a very elegant street but it does n't it has a concier and the poor man was also attacked by the robbers and he was in the courthouse talking as well and she apolog and the letter that apologized to her apologized to the concier but it 's not really a hotel it does n't have the security of a hotel it does n't have the same things that the whole point of that places luxury and anonymity and that probably will not be very good for whoever runs those places because they must be very nice but a hotel is a lot safer . . And Elizabeth Moute with the case of Kim Kardashian and the Grandpa Robbers tonight . Thank you ."

",DW news,Gqfw737JeuI,"Now to the Philippines where former president Rodrigo Duterte has been elected mayor in his home city of Dvao . Despite being in custody at the International Criminal Court in the Hague , the Dvau election board says Mr. Duterte won more than eight times as many votes as his closest rival . He was the city 's mayor for two decades before becoming president in 2016 . The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against him for crimes against humanity following his brutal war on drugs which left thousands dead . He 's currently awaiting trial . We can get more from journalist Dave Grunabal . , he joins us from the Philippines capital , Manila . Welcome Dave . So , how does a man in custody win an election by a landslide ? , to his supporters back in his hometown , Devow City , he 's just a legend who cracked down on crime , who cleaned up the streets . They will tell you that when before he came into office as mayor , there was just so much drugs and crime all over the city that he took the drug lords on directly and cleaned up the streets . That 's why they love him . But obviously , , to his detractors , he 's a cold - blooded killer . But in Devout City , they absolutely love him . and they came out in droves to show that support for him . As you said , he won by an 8 to1 margin over his closest competitor . And the people down there , they 're coming out to show not only their support for him , but to really send a message to the Marcos family for Marcos Jr. who 's the currently president because the people down in the vow city , they blame him for the fact that Marcos is now , excuse me , that Duterte is now sitting in the international criminal court . Because Marcos Jr. , the president he cleared the path for Duterte to be arrested and extradited . . So , Duterte be being detained by the ICC because of the deaths that followed during his cleanup of the streets . So , he 's there who runs Dvau while he 's in jail in the Netherlands . So , Duterte 's daughter Sarah , who 's currently the vice president , she says they 're talking to lawyers to see if there 's a way that he can get sworn into office . They would have till the end of June to really figure this all out hypothetically . So , they 're talking to lawyers to see , , if there 's a way he could still be mayor while he 's in detention in the A thousands of miles away . But I spoke to several political analysts and lawyers here today who tell me there 's just no way that 's going to happen . That if the Duterte really tried to make that happen that it would be challenged in court ahead of time and that the courts would never allow that to happen . assuming that 's correct and that and that would be the case . What happens is then is that the vice mayor assumes the responsibilities and that means it would go to Rodrigo Duterte 's son Sebastian . So it would just stay in the family . . Really is a family business there . And you mentioned that the daughter Sarah currently vice president who herself is facing impeachment . And I wonder if this massive victory for her dad is in any is in any way political politically helpful for his daughter . Not only does it help her and the whole Duterte brand , but more importantly , , there was a Senate election for 12 of the 24 Senate seats that also went on . And when you talk to political analysts of the way that lines up , the key thing for Sarah is the magic number of nine . Between all 24 seats , she makes needs to make sure that at least nine people would not convict her . and you to think these decisions are made based on the evidence , but the fact is in the Philippines for many of these senators , it 'll be based on which way the political winds are blowing that would favor them . And every analyst I spoke with say that Sarah Duterte has probably achieved that she 's now going to have enough people that would vote not to convict her . and the importance of that is that then would allow her to stay on track to run to be president in 2028 . Keep in mind the current president , Fern Marcos Jr. he 's limited to one term and if Sarah Duterte becomes the next president Marcos Jr. the current president would have a lot to be fearful of because then Sarah Tuterte could take revenge on him for clearing the path for her father to end up being sent to the international criminal court . So the drama could just continue here . . Philippines politics a family business . thanks for talking us through that Dave journalist Dave Grunabam ."
https://youtu.be/axJTDpPdY7M?si=zGIOX2vfAi8KjcjJ,What is the banned ‘Kingdom of Germany’ group?,DW news,axJTDpPdY7M,"We begin with breaking news . Germany has banned the group known as Kingdom of Germany , a prominent faction of the farright rash citizens movement . The German interior ministry said police had raided properties of key members , including that of founder Peter Fitzk across seven federal states . The group , which has established a self - proclaimed counterstate and even issued its own currency , has around 6,000 followers . German interior minister Alexander Tobberint says the group uses anti - semitic conspiracy theories to support its claim to sovereignty . Behavior that he said can not be tolerated in a state governed by the rule of law . Let 's get more from DW 's chief political correspondent Nina Haz . Nina , what can you tell us about this group that has now been banned ? , they call themselves the Kingdom of Germany and the abbreviation in German is KRD and I 'll use that just to make things easier . So they are considered to be the largest association from the so - called riceburgger so Rish citizen spectrum and overall Germany 's intelligence agency estimates that there are some 25,000 Rish citizens in this country and the group that was banned now is estimated to have some 6,000 followers . So who are they ? Who is the KRD ? Now they do n't recognize the Federal Republic of Germany as a state . They want to replace the system of this country with their own . They want to create a state territory that essentially would have the borders of the German Reich of 1871 , hence the name Reich citizens . So they do n't recognize democratic constitutional structures , parliament , laws , courts , etc . They also do n't want to pay any taxes or fines . And as for this particular group that was founded in 2012 , they 're accused of having set up a counter state and to have used illegal banks and financing methods in order to expand their influence and extend their territory . And Germany 's interior minister said that the KRD underpinned their claim to power with anti - semitic conspiracy narratives . So what 's been happening today then ? , Alexander Dubran says that they started a big raid this morning with hundreds of police officers searching properties and the homes of leading members in seven of Germany 's 16 federal states both in the east and the west of the country . And the goal was to confiscate some assets and secure further evidence that they indeed are aiming for anti - constitutional goals and activities . And they also arrested four alleged ring leaders including the founder of the KRD . And this is a man called Peter Fitzk . So these are all German men aged between 37 and 59 . They have been taken into custody on Tuesday morning . And they are to appear before an investigating judge in Katsura on Tuesday and Wednesday . And there was also a search in a home in Switzerland . And this is also the latest in a series of legal crackdowns on far- organizations . How big of a threat are they for democracy in Germany ? I think you have to be really specific what you 're talking about because the rice citizens themselves that is a scene that is extremely heterogeneous both organizationally and ideologically and the security authorities do n't yet believe that they have a uniform movement . So some of them are essentially really just people who do n't believe in the current German state . others are willing to take up arms and overthrow certain representatives of this current state . But definitely what is true is that all German intelligence agencies are in unison now and that is a different situation to a few years ago . That -wing extremism when it compares to left - wing extremism is a much bigger threat . We 'll leave it there for the moment . DW chief political correspondent Nina Hza . Thanks so much ."
https://youtu.be/qknzaw9OGDg?si=goCvldZXCIrAIbQ3,India-Pakistan ceasefire holds: What are the next steps?,DW news,qknzaw9OGDg,"India and Pakistan are in talks about the next steps after a ceasefire restored calm to the border region of Jammu and Kashmir which had been had seen its fiercest fighting in decades after what Delhi said were some early violations of the ceasefire . The Indian army said there had been no reports of fighting on Sunday night . Pakistan denies any ceasefire violations . The truce between the two nuclear powers announced by US President Donald Trump followed four days of intense fighting . Let 's cross straight over to our senior correspondent Shalu Yadv who 's in Rajuri in Indian administered Kashmir . This is one of the areas most affected by the recent violence . Shalu , the ceasefire seems to be holding . Is that the case where you are ? , Jerry . I 'm just about 15 miles from the line of control , the de facto border between the two countries , India and Pakistan . And here in it 's it 's after days that people have woken up to a peaceful morning . Really remember they have been in the shadow of a warlike situation for the last 4 days where they 've seen heavy artillery shelling coming and pounding their homes . lives have been lost . They 've seen drones flying over their homes and some really intense crossber firing Terry over the last four days . So today seems to have come as a sigh of relief but there 's still a little bit of tension on the ground . we 've been speaking to the locals here and they 've recounted how they spent four sleepless nights . they did n't even sleep on their beds fearing that a shell is going to land on them . So you can imagine how difficult these last four days must have been for them . And remember this is one of the worst confrontation that the two countries have seen in the last three decades . so and it 's only on in areas this in the border villages where the first victims are seen whenever these two countries are sparring this so clearly a sign of relief on the ground but also they remain on the edge Terry because just in this belt where I am in Rajari and Punch at least 20 lives have been lost and there 's a lot of fear still I 'm I 'm just next to a shelter and people here are telling me that they are still scared to go back home and see what lies there for them . Now , military chiefs from both sides , I understand , have spoken to each other over the phone today . , do we know what they discussed ? Has anything come out of those talks ? , as of now , we do n't know the exact details of what has transpired . , but there will be a press conference and , , details will be shared there . But we believe that , , that the modalities of that ceasefire is must have been discussed in that meetings . remember that there 's been a ceasefire in place between the two countries since 2003 but it has been broken time and again Terry so and given the nature of the current confrontation that we have seen which is very serious in nature I think it 's going to take a lot of effort on both sides to iron out the details of the ceasefire and the locals especially are keeping an eye out for the details of that call because they say that their future is at stake their future depends on the outcome of that call they want to be able to feel the confidence to be able to go back and pick up their lives . also remember Terry this the ceasefire came almost a snap decision between the two countries when they were really at the heights of the hostilities and India has made it very clear that if there is a ceasefire violation in the coming days it 's going to be met with a fitting and strong response . So people remain on the edge even if there is an uneasy calm in the town here . Shal thank you very much . DW senior correspondent Shahu Yadv from Rajuri in Indian administered Kashmir ."

Here on the Polish Baltic coast , tourists have found a baby seal . Yan is one of 200 volunteers on the WWF 's Blue Patrol . He checks on the seal 's state of health , reporting back to the local SEAL station . Dehydrated , malnourished , and injured in the face . This seal is only a few weeks old and completely exhausted . Without help , its chances of survival are slim . It 's the second baby seal that Yan has had to rescue this week alone . That 's because in spring , mother seals leave their pups , but not all of them can fend for themselves . [ Applause ] [ Music ] We 'll hand over the seal to the station and probably visit her in a few days . I hope that in a few weeks she can return to the Baltic . Jan 's passion for seals stems from the unique environment at his doorstep , the Bay of Gdansk , where the Vistula River meets the Baltic . , look , our first seal already . She 's hunting now . So , we 're bound to see more in a moment , I hope . We 're on our way to the Seals Islands . We never know what awaits us there . Robert Borata regularly brings tourists here on his boat . It 's the only place in Poland where you can see seals in their natural habitat . Just 50 years ago , seals were hunted here almost to extinction . But thanks to protection measures and volunteers Yan , the seal population in the Baltic has stabilized . [ Music ] When we talk about the seal 's situation , we should also consider the fact that there are fewer and fewer places for them to rest and give birth . There is still lots to do . Yan tells us every pup counts . We 're at Poland 's only seal sanctuary on the Hell Peninsula . We 've come to check in on Vlont , the seal pup we found with Yan . How 's my seal doing ? Vont arrived 3 days ago with a very high fever . We gave him medication which lowered his temperature and stabilized him . The next day , he was given water with electrolytes . His condition is stable , but we 're being cautious with our prognosis . We can go over , but we have to be really quiet . We can look at him . Yan 's hoping for a quick recovery so that by summer , little Velont can take to the waves of the Baltic once more . [ Music ]"
https://youtu.be/-FkKT56hKmU?si=l64ATA09khbSLc0e,US officials: Deal struck to cut China trade deficit,DW news,-FkKT56hKmU,"Now , US officials say , "" Substantial progress has been made in trade talks with China . "" Speaking in Geneva on the second day of negotiations , US Treasury Secretary Scott Bent offered scant information on the talks , but he said more details would be released later on Monday . The US announced massive tariffs on goods from China in April . And for more on the US China tariff talks , let 's talk to Sandra Navididi , CEO of the consulting firm Beyond Global . Sandra , thank you so much for joining us . There are no immediate details about what the agreement contains , but there 's a suggestion that it will reduce Beijing 's trade deficit with the US . How could this play out in practical terms ? , it remains to be seen what the result of the talks are going to be . They 're supposed to be announced tomorrow . , but Donald Trump has a consistent track record of overpromising and underdelivering . he has completely backed himself into a corner . So I think the maximum that we should expect at this time is probably that talks have resumed which is an accomplishment in and of itself and that escalation the risk of further escalation has been reduced . So a bit too early to say that the US China trade war may be over but perhaps the massive uncertainty that we 've seen in global markets will that disappear ? , the problem is that Donald Trump and his administration have proven themselves to be completely unreliable . Their arguments and explanations are entirely nonsensical . So , Wall Street and CEOs of big companies have nothing to go by and there 's no reliability . And I think the damage that has been done has already been grave and is probably will have a lasting impact even if an agreement will be reached between China and the US . Can you remind us a bit of the impact that this has had already ? , especially smaller companies , let 's say they bought inventory , ordered inventory from China for $ 100,000 . And now all of a sudden , in addition to this $ 100,000 , they have to pay another $ 145,000 . Smaller companies do n't have the liquidities . They wo n't get a bank loan for that because no customer in the world is able to pay for that . And then even bigger companies , they may be able to hold out longer , but even they are going to run into problems as many CEOs of big companies have told Donald Trump . And so we are currently only a few weeks away from empty shelves . I can tell you I live in New York and I myself , my friends , we have already stocked up stuff because we 're afraid simply of running out of things . Not only because the wares are going to become more expensive , but probably some things we ca n't get any longer because it 's not worthwhile economically for importers to bring them to the United States . Not a very optimistic message there . I wonder do a way forward that could get the situation to a better point ? , Donald Trump is unreliable . I think his adviserss are trying behind the scenes to get him to agree to lower tariffs because what is an agreement ? Even if Donald Trump were to lower tariffs for China to 80 % . That is also not economically viable . If it were at 50 % , maybe some companies could handle that . But tariffs would have to decrease substantially in order for a deal to work . and we are very far from an agreement . That 's Sandra Navididi . Thank you so much for those insights . My pleasure . Thank you very much for having me ."
https://youtu.be/GYVdrz7jUo4?si=EhES3qYvZn-uzEW4,How UK lawmakers hope to create a generation of non-smokers,DW news,GYVdrz7jUo4,"[ Music ] Britain is planning one of the strictest antismoking laws in the world . In a generation 's time , you could see that tobacco becomes a footnote in history . It wants to phase out the sale of tobacco products , creating the first ever smoke - free generation . It 'd be very nice to be a part of that . . Gary started smoking in his early teens . Now at just 40 , he 's facing heart bypass surgery after suffering a heart attack believed to be linked to his decades long habit . I thought I was invincible , but I 'm not . He 's also lost some of his sight in both eyes . Smoking , he says , has dramatically changed his life . I believe I 've I 've spent a lot of my life thinking it would n't happen to me . I 'll be all . I 'm still a smoker . laugh at the people that think it 's bad , but it has taken until this moment in time to realize the hardship of it . It 's scary . It really is . It 's stories Garry 's which the government in London wants to prevent . It 's planning new laws to phase out the sale of tobacco products and create Britain 's first smoke - free generation . So , how will it work ? It would become an offense to sell tobacco products to anyone born on or after January 1st , 2009 , meaning the legal age , now 18 , will rise every year . It 's a radical proposal , which public health charity Ash says is long overdue . It 's a completely proportionate response to the harms that smoking causes . It 's really very difficult to think of another product that is even vaguely similar to cigarettes . Smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths in Britain , claiming up to 80,000 lives every year . Figures the government says will be slashed by this new legislation . The UK government has predicted that by sometime in the 2040s , smoking rates among those aged 14 to 30 will be effectively zero . In a generation 's time , you could see that tobacco becomes a footnote in history . It is truly transformative moment for British society . The legislation has broad political support and according to a study commissioned by Ash , it 's backed by 69 % of the public with just 12 % against . For smokers at this London pub , nothing will change . But opinion is still divided . But whatever laws they bring in , there 's always a way to get around it , is n't it ? It 's just ridiculous . Just another nanny state thing , I suppose you 'd call it , is n't it ? Swear I 'm in the older generation . It 's easier . You take it for granted . You can go to shop , buy them and that 's it . So they do got the rules in of ca n't it which should help the kids and hopefully they 'll have a better life than what our generation did . But here at this London youth club , support among those it will affect is universal . Alfred is 14 and would never be able to legally buy tobacco products . He considers this a badge of honor . It 'd be very nice to be a part of that . I promise to never ever do in my life . As my mom and brother , they cough a lot after a while cuz they 've smoked . And so that 's why I 'm thinking never to do it . Alfred and his friends say they have never smoked . The number of smokers among their generation has dropped in recent years while youth vaping has risen in part , says Alfred , due to the way it 's marketed . Crazy . People are creating more vapes and stuff that . And cigarettes have been the same overall . And I think that cuz there 's more flavors of vapes as well . So they might try a different flavor now and then and they might that one and they just might all of them . Under the legislation , the government also plans to stop companies from marketing vapes to young people . But as far as Alfred 's concerned , it should go even further . Really far . as far as they can banning everything they poss they can they get their hands on something to do with smoking , vaping , anything to do with smoking and stuff that . Back at the hospital , Gary is preparing for life after his operation . He 's part of a successful program designed to help people quit smoking . The first thing for future generations , why put yourself in that position ? If it was that when I was younger , when I started off and it was less available , , then I would n't be here today . MPs in the House of Commons have approved the legislation and it is currently progressing through the House of Lords . If passed , Britain will become a world leader in tobacco control starting in 2027 ."
https://youtu.be/Qguh3LvpJ7Q?si=36xpFTJUZDutTxjs,US-China trade talks: Who has the upper hand? ,DW news,Qguh3LvpJ7Q,"US President Donald Trump has hailed ongoing trade talks with China , saying the two sides had negotiated a total reset . In a truth social post , Trump praised the discussions and deemed them a total reset negotiated in a friendly but constructive manner . It comes ahead of a second day of closed - door meetings in Geneva between top officials from the world 's two largest economies . The talks aim to diffuse a trade war that threatens the global economy . Let 's bring in DW 's East Asia correspondent Melissa Chan in Taipei . Melissa , do we have a sense of which side wants or needs a deal more at this point ? , both sides need a deal . But at this moment , it appears as if Chinese leader Xi Jinping is more in grips with the facts . And the facts are for his country , China , China has great economic imbalances . He 's aware that there is massive unemployment in the country and that there is a housing crisis and the manufacturing in China can definitely pivot and export to other countries in the meantime . But ultimately , American consumers , American buyers , they definitely love buying more than anyone else in the world . And that 's going to be a problem because factories in China have a very short timeline . Those dolls and those clothes of a few weeks before they might go bankrupt because the turnover and the margins are so tight . but here is something that Xi Jinping has as an advantage . He does n't have to deal with the midterms . he does n't have to worry about the latest CNN or ABC News poll in terms of what his citizens think about him . The challenge though is that US President Donald Trump appears to be unperturbed by facts such as the ports in Los Angeles and also in Oakland not getting in shipments or the inability of American companies to pay the tariffs that they had not planned for and do n't have the cash for . And that is going to be a massive pain on the American economy . And of course , there are the dire warnings from so many people that the shelves might go empty in a matter of weeks . So both sides need to reach a deal . but at this moment , one of the leaders seems a bit more relaxed than the other one in terms of the urgency . Make no mistake about it , still very much a dynamic situation . Stepping back a bit beyond trade , where do US China relations overall stand at the moment ? The best thing that can happen now for the world is for the two leaders to meet and just deescalate the situation . And this is something that US President Donald Trump has expressed a great interest in . The problem is that President Trump caused this challenge himself because not that long ago in the Oval Office , everyone saw what happened an ambush against Ukrainian president Vladimir Zalinski . The last thing that the Chinese leader can handle and deal with is if he is disrespected on the world stage that and the unpredictability of the American president is presenting a challenge for the Chinese in terms of agreeing to a one - on - one . And that is really the thing that needs to happen now because one of the challenges from Beijing is that they do n't know who 's in charge . They might send an envoy from Washington DC to negotiate with the Chinese in Switzerland . but whether that person has the ear of Donald Trump is another matter . That 's a DW 's East Asia correspondent Melissa Chan in Taipei . Thanks Melissa ."

This is our town hall 's largest room , the historic citizens chamber . The building is over 500 years old . Then the registar declares the two married and then the documents are signed here at this beautiful old table . In andout weddings are booming in Denmark . Though unlike Las Vegas , the US wedding capital , Denmark is steeped in history . Couples come from all over the world . Australia , Canada , the US , Southeast Asia , Japan , China , Russia , from everywhere . It really is worldwide . Udit met Ivan in Uganda in 2023 . They 've been living together in Bond , Germany since last year . So why are they marrying in Denmark ? We met the couple before their big day to find out . Last year , Ivonne moved to Germany on a work visa . He plans to study resource management . This year you were not able to extend your visa because of some restrictions to your work . And we were , "" , we need to figure something out to stay together . "" getting married in German for me would mean another about one year of waiting for my documents to be certified or something that and then also paying money about € 1,000 just to have my documents worked on and we there must be another way . So in case I follow the German bureaucracy it would take us another year or so to just get married . So we had to find another way and Denmark was the answer . They started planning , set a date , and picked a registry office in Denmark . Everything went pretty quickly , including the paperwork . In Denmark , it 's super easy . You apply online . They give you feedback within 5 days . You only need to take your passport and a proof of relationship , which is very easy . That was a funny one . , and , we got the go get go in 5 days and , , a date , , an appointment to get married within 3 weeks . So , super smooth so far . It 's been amazing . A few weeks later in Reeb , their big moment has arrived . After getting their documents scanned , Ivan makes his marriage vows . I love you in sickness and in health , in poverty and in riches , until we meet our father in heaven , who teaches us to love each other and has called us to celebrate his love in marriage . Just 15 minutes later , they 're husband and wife . Now we 're married . Now , no one in the world can tell us this is not or we ca n't be together . it just feels nice to be able to make this step and say we are one from now on before the law and before ourselves and to just have this love . But does Germany recognize Danish marriages ? German law recognizes marriages performed abroad according to local law without a formal recognition procedure ? This means the wedding certificate from the foreign registry office , in this case the Danish registry office , provides proof that the couple is married . UD Ivonne can look forward to a bright future together and clink glasses to that . They 're confident that now they can overcome any bureaucratic obstacle in their way . And they 'll always think fondly of Denmark and the little town of Reeba ."

Speaking in an early morning press conference at the Kremlin , Putin did not agree to a 30 - day ceasefire to take effect on Monday . That was the demand from the leaders of Germany , Poland , France , and the UK , who traveled to Kiev for talks with President Zilinski and also spoke to Donald Trump by phone in Washington . The allies threatened Russia with increased sanctions if it failed to agree to the truce . For more on this now , I 'm joined by DW reporter Matthew Manion . Matthew , quite an ultimatum there that President Putin seems appears to have rejected already . what more did he have to say ? , gathered journalists had waited more than an hour for Vladimir Putin to turn up to make this statement . They did n't know what he was going to say and he did n't turn up to nearly just before 2:00 a.m. local time in the morning . and perhaps unsurprisingly , there was no direct response to that ultimatum from Keev and those European allies you mentioned . they had earlier pressed Russia for that 30 - day ceasefire to start on Monday . They said otherwise Russia would face massive new sanctions and new weapons deliveries to Ukraine . what we got instead from Vladimir Putin was a counter proposal , an offer not for a ceasefire but for direct talks between Moscow and Keev . He said these talks could take place in the Turkish city of Istanbul starting as early as this coming Thursday . That 's May the 15th . Now he called this a resumption of negotiations started in 2022 in Istanbul where Russian and Ukrainian negotiators held direct talks in the first weeks of the conflict but failed to agree a halt to the fighting . Putin said he would speak to the Turkish president later on Sunday about facilitating these talks and it 's really not clear if Turkey was aware of this proposal before it was made by President Putin . , I will tell you a little bit more about what Putin had to say and I quote , he said , "" We are committed to serious negotiations with Ukraine . Their purpose is to eliminate the root causes of the conflict to establish a long - term lasting peace . We do not rule out that during these negotiations it will be possible to agree on some new truce , a new ceasefire . "" And he said the decision is now up to the Ukrainian authorities and their curators who are guided , he said it seems , by their personal political ambitions and not by their interests of their peoples . You 've already mentioned that there has n't been a response from Kiev yet , but have we heard from any of Kev 's allies ? We 've had nothing so far , but it will now be interesting to see just how President Zalinski and those European allies react . will they now accept this new proposal or double down their demands of a ceasefire to start on Monday ? A ceasefire demand that was also backed by US President Donald Trump who they informed over telephone after those talks . they will no doubt see this as more the same though from President Putin , more delaying tactics as they see it from a man whose commitment to peace they have questioned . Now Putin 's reference to the root causes of the Ukraine conflict is a phrase we 've heard before from Russia . They 've used it repeatedly when arguing that it was forced to go to war to prevent the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO . Now , Ukraine and its Western allies often say this was a false pretext , what they call an imperial style invasion . Now , of particular interest will be just how the US and President Donald Trump reacts now to this Putin proposal . The Trump administration has been increasingly frustrated that it 's not been able to get any progress over any peace talks . and it did call for a 30 - day truce and negotiations take place in March . Ukraine agreed . Russia though at that time asked for several preconditions and it 's hard to see what 's changed this time . Thank you for bringing us all of that background . That 's DW reporter Matthew Manion ."

The leaders of France , Germany , and the UK have arrived in Ukraine . French President Emanuel Mron , German Chancellor Friedrich Mets , and UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer are in Kev to discuss ceasefire plans with President Vladimir Zalinski . They have been joined by Poland 's leader Donald Tusk . The group wants Russia to agree to a full and unconditional 30 - day truce to pave the way for lasting peace . It 's the first time leaders of four European nations are on a joint visit to Ukraine . I can speak now to DW correspondent Rebecca Ritters who joins me now from Kev . Rebecca , this is the first joint visit of these four European leaders to Ukraine . Anything concrete we should expect today ? , Michael , as we see with every high level visit to K , there 's a lot of discussion , a lot of conjecture about what concrete any leader will be bringing . That 's no different today . Of course , it 's unlikely and of course would be very unpopular if these four leaders turned up to Kiev empty - handed . So , it 's , , almost certain that they will be bringing with them something concrete to be able to hand over to President Zilinski . exactly what is in any is in their suitcases today of course will remain top secret until the leaders have met and we see the press we see them address the press in the aftermath of that but one thing concrete I if you want to call it that they are bringing and that 's something that they have certainly been championing and been discussing in the media in the leadup to this is one is that this is a show of European solidarity and steadfast support for Ukraine of Of course , this comes at a time when the US 's steadfast support has been faltering since the since Donald Trump has come into office . Though we have seen the relations between the US and Ukraine soften in the in recent days and weeks since President Trump and President Zanski met at the funeral of Pope Francis . But , this is certainly a show of unity . It comes just a few days after the German chancellor Fredish Mertz was is now in the ch in the chancellor 's seat and this the four very high level leaders of the European Union coming together is certainly a show of solidarity . Now the four are coming of course to discuss this 30 - day ceasefire and that is going to be top of their agenda . Rebecca the four leaders form again part of the so - called coalition of the willing . remind our viewers again who is part of it and what 's the objective . , this coalition of the willing was formed a couple of months ago . It was the formation of this group was led by the UK and France but is signed on by the European Union and some other allies as well . more than 30 nations leaders and a part of this coalition of the willing and it is again trying a show of support for Ukraine . the aim is to facilitate these ceasefire or peace negotiations and that is the main aim of this group but this is probably they 've had several sittings so far . This is the latest meeting of the group . They will be holding the four leaders here in person with President Zalinski , but they 'll be holding a virtual meeting with the other leaders of the group and they 'll be discussing their updated plans of something that has been that one of the things that they have been championing , which is a potential peacekeeping force to monitor any ceasefire that may happen in the future . So , that 's something that they 'll be updating today and that 's certainly one of the key tenants of this coalition of the willing . Of course , a ceasefire has been on the table , but how do they get Russia on board ? , of course , that is the million - dollar question , Michael . , no ceasefire , of course , can come to fruition if Vladimir Putin does n't get inv time and time again . This US suggested 30 - day ceasefire is something that he keeps refusing . The Ukraine has said they would be on board with . so just how they 're going to get him across the line remains to be seen . we 've seen in the past that he 's unwilling to bow to international pressure and it 's unlikely that if he does n't get something that he wants that he 's going to come to the party on this either . So exactly how the international community can pressure him remains to be seen . There is talk of another sanctions package that is being devised if he continues to refuse . But , as I say , , this ceasefire agreement can not take place without his approval and everyone is continuing waiting , hoping that they can negotiate him into that corner . DW correspondent Rebecca Ritters in Kev . Many thanks , Rebecca ."

Stateron TV in Pakistan says the country has launched a retaliatory military operation against India . Operation Bunan Merus , which translates to a firm wall of lead , is targeting military facilities in India . The Pakistani military released this video and said they 've used medium - range fat missiles to target a missile storage facility in Punjab and air bases in Patanot and Udampur . The assault was described as a response to Indian missiles targeting Pakistani air bases . This comes after a third day of heavy crossber fighting . It 's the worst confrontation between the two nuclear armed neighbors in decades . Now days earlier , India carried out air strikes in Pakistan in retaliation for last month 's attack on 26 tourists in Indian controlled Kashmir . Pakistan has rejected Indian claims that it was behind the attack . For more now I 'm joined by DW Delhi Bureau Chief Zandra Petisman . Zandra , thank you so much for being here . Pakistan 's military says it has launched a military operation against India . What more can you tell us about operation Bunyan Ul Marus ? Nih . We have a team traveling at the line of control that is effectively dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan . The team obviously is on the Indian side of this line of control . The team has been sheltering in Rajawi for the past couple of hours and they have been reporting intense fighting there last night and then again a huge flare up this morning . they reported large explosions if drones were at play this morning as well . We can not confirm but they were definitely used last night . Also very heavy artillery shelling . So the team had to shelter in the basement of the location where they were staying . And this we can also corroborate with official information from the Indian site because one senior government official in the district of Rajori has been killed as a shell hit his house . Also explosions this morning were reported from both Jamu and Sinaga the two biggest cities in Indian administered Kashmir also from Amitritza in neighboring Punjab state . So this is definitely a huge escalation and all of this has to be seen in the light of 3 days of intense hostilities , increasing hostilities with all sorts of heavy weapons at play but mainly carried out with drones from both sides . Now Pakistan also claims that India fired missiles at three air bases inside the country . Has India responded to this ? So far we have no confirmation official confirmation from the Indian side yet but there will be an official press briefing very soon which we of course will follow and then update accordingly . But Pakistan indeed claims that it has targeted multiple locations in India this morning after India attacked three of their air bases with missiles during the night and one of the air bases apparently attacked was Rabal Pendi . Now this is significant because Rabal Pendi is the headquarter of Pakistan 's army . It is also very close to Pakistan 's capital Islamabad . And we are looking currently at the worst hostilities between these two nuclear armed nations in three decades . Having said this , we also need to be very careful . There is a lot that we can not independently verify . We rely on the official sources and there is a lot of active disinformation happening by state and non - state actors . Social media is flooded with fake news . Thank you for sharing that with us DW 's Sandra Petersman ."

At one point , the whole of Ukraine was under an air alert as missiles were fired from the Black Sea and strategic bombers in Russia . Officials in the Ukrainian capital said around a dozen enemy drones had reached Kiev 's airspace , which forced thousands to take shelter in metro stations and basement . It comes as the biggest prisoner of war exchange so far between Russia and Ukraine is now complete . These are the latest pictures we 've received from Ukraine 's capital . 12 people are reported to have been killed in Kiev . The Ukrainian president Vladimir Zilinski 's warned that America 's silence and the silence of others in the world only encourages Vladimir Putin . Our correspondent in Kiev , James Waterhouse , says the impact of the overnight strikes are farreaching . This was a night where , according to Ukraine 's air force , you 've got more than 360 missiles and drones . That is the highest number yet since Russia started launching these huge air assaults in late 2022 . In the time since Moscow has been able to manufacture these drones at a far a much faster rate , there 's also an arms race when it comes to drones between Ukraine and Russia . Both are being fitted with more sophisticated technology and packed with more explosives . And I think that is now translating into , , in the case of this weekend for cities Kev , 48 hours of pretty sustained bombardment . , last night the sirens went at midnight and there were explosions all the way through until sunrise . , the skies were lit up with search lights and you could hear air defenses going off . You could see the occasional drone intercepted . you could hear their motors and several regions in central , northern , southern Ukraine were targeted in this way . and that is why President Zilinski is again urging his allies to put more pressure on Russia to not just stop fighting , stop these aerial assaults , but also to engage in a ceasefire . But at the moment his calls are falling on deaf ears . James Waterhouse ."

The 46 - y old black man was killed during a police arrest in Minneapolis in 2020 . Video of Derek Schovin , a white police officer , kneeling on Mr. Floyd 's neck for around 9 minutes as he struggled to breathe sparked global protests and a national conversation about racial injustice . Five years on , the Trump administration is rolling back many of the policies prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement police reform and diversity , equity , and inclusion programs . In an interview marking the anniversary of his brother 's death , George Floyd 's younger brother said he 'd committed to keeping his brother 's legacy alive through activism .

Mr. Trump has come back to the office promising to roll back these policy which he sees as a reverse discrimination which undermines merit - based society . His justice department said that they will stop the police reform agreement which his predecessor had been negotiating with the city of Minneapolis and Louisville , Kentucky . even though inquiries have found that police departments in these cities have problems of racial discrimination . Now Mr. Trump is also purging his government of any diversity , equity , and inclusion programs . saying that these must be purged out of also universities and sports as well as law firms across the country .

They were given prison sentences of up to 8 years . The most of the terms were suspended . Two people were acquitted . Kim Kardashian says the robbery had been the most terrifying experience of her life . Andrew Harding has this report and a warning . It does contain some flashing images . In central Paris , justice at long last in the case of the Kardashian jewel heist . It was last week that Kim Kardashian , global celebrity in black and diamonds here , flew into the French capital to give evidence at the trial . She described her terror that she would be raped or killed by the masked robbers who entered her Paris hotel room back in 2016 . But she also spoke of forgiveness . And it is forgiveness or at least leniency that the accused were pleading for in court . Many of them are now elderly and sick . 71 - year - old Ununice Abbas , who 's wrestling with Parkinson 's . He 's described the Kardashian jewel heist as a final job before retirement . I was hesitant . I thought I was too old , but in the end , I took up the challenge . As soon as the job was done , I regretted it . Kardashian had been in Paris for fashion week . The gang appears to have targeted her after seeing her with her jewelry on social media . She was bound and gagged at gunpoint before the thieves escaped . The stolen jewels themselves , gold and diamonds worth perhaps 6 million pounds were probably smuggled out of France , broken up and sold . They 've never been found . As for the gang , the jury found almost all of them guilty , but no more time in prison for any of the elderly criminals who 've waited 9 years for justice . There were probably two reasons . first the age of those people and second probably the time between u the facts and the trial . As for Kim Kardashian in a statement she thanked French justice described the robbery as the most terrifying experience of her life and prayed for healing for all concerned .

https://youtu.be/-zKiDLqBmUU?si=eOHz1sSzeOuQ8d1C,Arne Slot: Excuses are for teams that don’t win the League,BBC news,-zKiDLqBmUU,"Liverpool 's head coach Anna Slot has told the BBC that excuses are for teams that do n't win the league . In an exclusive interview , the Dutchman , who 's just won the Premier League at the first attempt , also said he hopes Trent Alexander Arnold gets a positive farewell in his final game this weekend . He 's been talking to our sports editor Dan Ran . Liverpool are the champions of England in honor slots first season in the country . He 's the Dutch football manager that 's made almost the perfect start to his time at Anfield . An Slopp 's been celebrating leading Liverpool to the Premier League title , defying expectations after taking over from legendary former coach Jurgen Klopp ahead of the final game of the season . I met him at the club 's training ground to reflect on his success . Is it hard to believe sometimes what just what you 've achieved in your first season here ? Not as much now anymore . I think the moment the referee blew his whistle , you were , "" , this is really happen . "" , but now after all the celebrations and it definitely synced in and all the excuses that always been made if a team does n't win the league , it 's nice that if you have all these excuses that you do n't have to use them , but you still just want it . Jurgen left this team in a great place because the culture of this team has been a joy to step into . There have been issues to navigate . Having confirmed he was leaving his boyhood club at the end of the season , Liverpool defender Trent Alexander Arnold was booed by some fans . What would your hopes be in terms of the reaction to him when he gets his winners medal ? It would be fantastic if it 's only going to be a positive moment for everyone at the club and Trent is part of that . I hope every player gets what he deserves for what he did this season . Do you realistically now need to strengthen this summer ? City will probably strengthen the squad again . If the rumors are correct , Arsenal is planning the same . So , it would be stupid if we are not looking . It 's not that easy because this team has already won the league . There are certain players in the world where I think if they would come would be nice , but they 're also playing at tops where they do n't want to leave . We will try to get them . How special will that be for you to go on that bus parade with hundreds of thousands of Liverpool fans ? I think these moments will be one of the most special moments in your life professional wise maybe the most special moment and to do this with 100,000 people which were there at finer was very special but to do it with a multiple of that will probably be a one once in a lifetime experience . Although we are planning to win a few things more at this club . so let 's hope it 's not going to be the last time . But it 's going to be a moment that I will cherish for the rest of my life ."

The so - called breakout time , at which point Iran will have produced enough weaponsgrade uranium for a bomb , is close to zero , perhaps a matter of weeks . Whether they have the technical know - how to develop a bomb is another question . The IAEA , which inspects the declared enrichment sites , one of them an underground facility in Natans , the other buried inside a mountain at Foda , do not have the access they once had . There is a lot . the international community does not know about Iran 's intentions . All of which makes today 's negotiations currently ongoing in Rome , the fifth round of talks between the White House and Iran all the more critical . The US special envoy Steve Wickoff is there in Italy with orders to seal a diplomatic solution which Donald Trump believes is in reach . I want to make a deal with Iran . I want to do something if it 's possible . But for that to happen , it must stop sponsoring terror , halt its bloody proxy wars , and permanently and verifiably cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons . They can not have a nuclear weapon . The Israelis think it 's all futile . In fact , some months ago , the defense minister , Israel Kat , said he thought Iran was more exposed than ever to an attack on its nuclear facilities . A series of reports this week based on leaked US intelligence suggests the Israeli air force is now well advanced in those plans with or without US backing . Iran 's defense minister warned on Sunday that will not hesitate to retaliate were to come under attack . The White House seems sufficiently concerned that Donald Trump raised this with Benjamin Netanyahu when they spoke last night following the murder of the two Israeli diplomats in Washington . Hammed Riza Azizi is an Iran analyst . He gave us his view of the talks . I think as we proceed with the negotiations and now we enter the fifth round it 's getting more and more complicated . We saw how tense the whole issue was over the past few days and the statements coming from both sides . The red lines that both Donald Trump the US side and also the Iranian supreme leader tried to depict all this means that now talks have entered into a very serious stage . On one hand , the very fact that they are still committed to this diplomatic path could be a good sign . but then the core issue seems to be the ability Iranian ability to enrich uranium which some US officials especially special envoy Vitkov have said that it is a red line . But on the other side , has completely ruled out the possibility of stopping enriching uranium within the Iranian territory . . , as you suggest , so often it comes to the internal conversation within Iran . It 's the doves versus the hawks and it 's the signaling that we get from the supreme leader that we have to watch . Does he want to deal ? if he did n't want to deal I think the Iranian delegation would n't have been engaged in negotiations and they would n't have been in Rome today for a new round . So what we have seen over the past few months particularly since February when K first ruled out negotiations and he said that it is not honorable not logical to talk and then he allowed this . It seems that there seems to be a division of labor . So at the executive level , of course , the administration , the foreign ministry in this case is in charge of actual negotiation and diplomatic engagement . But as everybody especially the United States administration knows that it is in the end a decision of the supreme leader . He comes in from time to time to clarify the red lines in order in his view to give enough material to bargain and at the same time close the door to any u unwanted compromise that the more moderate administration might be willing to accept but not himself . the days a speaking to me a little time ago ."

It captures the sound at the very moment the vessel imploded thousand meters below the surface . It was on its way to view the wreck of the Titanic . , now a BBC documentary team has been given unprecedented access to the investigation . Our science editor Rebecca Morurell has more on that . It was a trip that turned to tragedy . A submersible heading to the Titanic 3,800 m down . Position Gates Titan sub suffered a catastrophic failure , killing all five people on board . They were British explorer Haish Harding , Sullean Darwood and his father , British Pakistani businessman Jazard Darwood , French diver PH Nile , and Stockton Rush Oceangate CEO . The US Coast Guard 's Marine Board of Investigation is looking into the disaster . Footage they recently discovered from Titan support ship has been submitted as evidence for their investigation . You will hear a noise that is external to the ship . . Or external to the room , I should say , and you will see their reaction to the noise . Stockton Rush 's wife Wendy is waiting for messages from the sub as it nears the sea floor . What was that bang ? So , at that point , you said , "" What was that bang ? "" What was that bang ? I 'm going to back up and play it one more time . It sounds a door slamming . Should be about 5:30 . . What was that thing ? The noise is a sound of Titan imploding . But moments later , Wendy Rush gets a message from the sub . Drop two weights . tight . Drop two weights . She mistakenly seems to think everything 's , but in fact , it 's taken longer for the message to arrive than the sound of the implosion . Everyone on board is dead . The US Coast Guard says it has also now identified the moment the sub started to fail . This is a full scale model of the Titan submersible . At the front there 's a titanium dome with a viewport . And at the rear is another dome covered by a tail cone . The passengers were in this middle section , the hull . It 's made from carbon fiber , a material that 's highly unpredictable at depth . The hull is 5 in 13 cm thick , and it 's made up of multiple layers . But these layers can come apart , a known problem called delamination . The sub was fitted with multiple sensors , and in 2022 , during Titan 's 80th dive , they picked up a loud bang . Stockton Rush said the noise was probably the sub shifting in its frame . But analysis of the data now shows this was the layers of carbon fiber breaking apart . Every dive after this one was a disaster waiting to happen . Their system said there has been a fundamental change in the material of your carbon fiber and it was no longer structurally sound . Delamination at dived was the beginning of the end and everyone that stepped on board the Titan after dived was risking their life . Ocean gate have told the BBC , "" We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died . Ocean Gates permanently wound down its operations and focused its resources on fully cooperating with the investigations being conducted . They said it would be inappropriate to respond further while we await the AY 's reports . The disaster happened in a split second , but the ramifications continue . The US Coast Guard will publish their full report in the coming months . Rebecca Moral , BBC News ."

The White House has accused the institution of fostering violence and anti - semitism and says the university is n't doing enough to limit the power students have on campus . Harvard , on the other hand , says the government 's acting illegally . The US Homeland Security Secretary is Christy Gnome and she told Fox News why the government 's targeting Harvard . They have promoted and allowed violent activity on campus . They have allowed anti - semitism participation with CCP and Chinese infiltration and influence on their campus and they have n't protected their students . so we have given them multiple opportunities to share criminal activity with us backgrounds on these students to let us conduct the oversight into this program . That is our responsibility and they have refused to do so . , our senior North America correspondent John Sudworth has more background on the story . , almost from the moment of his inauguration , Donald Trump began pressuring America 's elite universities over what he saw as woke ideology in their teaching and anti - semitism on their campuses , in particular over their handling of pro Palestinian protests . Harvard though was the first to really push back against some of that pressure , launching legal action over a decision to freeze some $ 2 billion of its federal grants and refusing to comply with the suggestion that it ought to alter its curriculum and its hiring practices . Now , the administration has clearly doubled down , halting Harvard 's ability to enroll international students who make up a quarter of its 24,000 strong student body and of course bring in a significant amount of income . In a letter to Harvard , the Homeland Security Secretary Christy Nome said this . She said that Harvard had been fostering violence , anti - semitism , and coordin coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party . It 's unclear what this means for students who are currently enrolled and here on visas . the suggestion is that they may have to leave the United States unless they can find alternative courses with other universities . But Harvard in its response said this . It called the decision unlawful and it says it threatens serious harm not only to the university but to the country and it seems likely many people suggest that there will be further legal action over this decision and so the fate of existing students may be now with the US courts ."

US authorities say they believe the man acted alone . Following the shooting , Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit out at allies , claiming that anti - semitism and anti - Israel is incitement by European governments is to blame for the attack . Police say the gunman approached the couple , Sarah Mgram and Yaron Lechinski , and opened fire as they left an event at the Jewish Museum in the city center last night . Here 's Sarah Smith . This was a shocking crime in the heart of Washington . A young couple shot dead as they left an evening event at the Jewish Museum . The suspected gunman had been seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before the shooting . Eyewitnesses unwittingly sheltered him after the attack . Around 9:07 , we heard gunshots and then a guy came in looking really distressed and we thought that he just needed help . we thought he was experiencing the whatever violence or something . He just needed safe shelter . So he comes in and so people were calming him down , bringing him water , taking care of him . Little did we know he was somebody that executed people in cold blood . He was the shooter . He was a shooter . the shooter . The suspect , 30 - year - old Elas Rodriguez , gave himself up to the police , telling them where he discarded the gun , shouting pro Palestinian slogans as he was led away . Free Palestine , free . [ Music ] Sarah Mgrren from Kansas and Yaron Lejinski , who was born in Israel , met at work when she joined the Israeli embassy about 18 months ago . They quickly started dating and were due to travel to Jerusalem this weekend where she would meet his parents for the first time . The couple that was gunned down tonight in the name of Free Palestine , it 's a young couple about to be engaged . The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem . The suspect 's apartment in Chicago has been raided by police . Social media accounts linked to him display his anger over the war in Gaza . Authorities are now working to authenticate what appears to be a manifesto he posted online accusing Israel of genocide and discussing the use of political violence . The White House says the killings are based on anti - semitism that has no place in America . The Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law . Hatred has no place in the United States of America under President Donald Trump . Outside the Jewish Museum , a spontaneous vigil was held . How can we stand here it 's normal ? In Israel , politicians are blaming what they call toxic anti - semitism . They say is being encouraged by world leaders who 've called for Israel to end the war in Gaza . I say to President Mcron , Prime Minister Carney , and Prime Minister Starmer when mass murderers , rapists , baby killers , and kidnappers Thank you . You 're on the wrong side of justice . You 're on the wrong side of humanity , and you 're on the wrong side of history . In New York , armed guards have been stationed outside this synagogue . In Washington , police say they believe the suspect was acting alone and there is no ongoing threat to the public . Now , what you heard the Israeli prime minister referring to there was a joint statement that came from Sir Kir Starmer , the French president and the Canadian prime minister earlier this week in which they called for Israel to stop its military action in Gaza , saying the situation there was now intolerable and that the amount of aid that was getting in was utterly inadequate . , number 10 today did n't want to comment directly on the criticism that was coming from Mr. Netanyahu , but they did point to a statement that Sir had posted on X a little earlier in which he condemned this attack here in Washington and said that anti - semitism is an evil that we must stamp out . The French foreign ministry have been a little more direct . They characterized that criticism from Mr. Netanyahu as completely outrageous and completely unjustified ."

That 's 3 days after Israel lifted an 11week total blockade on aid deliveries . Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected international criticism about the humanitarian situation in Gaza . , for more , let 's speak to our correspondent , Wira Davis , who 's at the Kerum Shalom border crossing . We 're some aid getting through , but from all that we 're hearing from aid agencies , clearly still not enough to meet the needs of what is a very dire humanitarian situation . , many UN agencies , including the World Food Program , are talking about the 2.1 million people in Gaza who are at risk of famine . Starvation is directly affecting about a quarter of the population , says the WFP , and they 're been trying to get more aid in , of course , after that 11week long Israeli blockade . Now , Israel partially lifted that blockade earlier this week . And today , we 've seen several trucks coming in carrying mainly flour . There 's been an agreement by the Israeli government after criticism from the Americans and others to allow very basic food materials in . the problem in the last couple of days though , even though about 90 trucks had crossed the border , is that they were n't able to be picked up on the other side by Palestinian drivers , largely because of the security situation there . The UN had told us that they did n't feel happy with the route that the Israeli army wanted them to take through populous areas where looting and theft by armed gangs would be a real issue , especially with so little aid getting through . What the UN has been saying is that you need almost need to flood Gaza with aid . So it drives away that insecurity . It drives down the black market prices for things flour and sugar and milk . But at the minute only about 90 trucks have got through . But they have fortunately been able to clear the problems on the other side of the border . And most of that flour has now been taken to warehouses and bakeries in Gaza where some of those starving people can start to get some of the very basic food they need . But as we 've been hearing all week from various agencies , when you take the lack of medicines , the lack of fuel for desalination plants and the lack of fresh food , about 600 trucks a day are needed . What we 're seeing now is at most about 90 trucks a day . , and it is really in drips and drabs . Just very briefly , just remind us what 's happening on the ground in terms of that ongoing offensive . , , all morning we 've been hearing the booms of Israeli air strikes and Israeli artillery fire here . That Israeli military action has been stepped up . 30 people killed in Gaza reportedly in the last few hours and more than 600 since this Israeli military offensive was really stepped up . So , Israel 's military action very much continuing . , where Davis is at the KM Shalom border crossing . Thank you very much for bringing us up to date on the ongoing aid situation in Gaza ."

UN officials say that Palestinians in Gaza are still waiting for aid to arrive two days after the lifting of a blockade on aid . Here 's Lucy Williamson . For 19 months , they 've been looking for the end of the road in Gaza . Home as elusive as the end of the war . Families who 've been moving for more than a year were moving again today as Israel 's army issued new displacement orders and its prime minister laid out his plan for Gaza 's future . Our forces are capturing more and more areas to clear them of terrorists and kamas terror infrastructures . At the end of this process , all areas of the Gaza Strip will be under Israeli security control and kamas will be completely defeated . Also , in Mr. Netanyahu 's plan , the suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Gaza 's entire population leave for other countries . I am ready to end the war on clear terms that will ensure Israel 's security . The hostages return home . Kamas disarms and its leadership is expelled . We 're implementing the Trump plan . Gaza residents who want to leave will be able to leave . Israel is under immense international pressure to end the war . A recent aid blockade has triggered new rifts with key allies the UK . More than a hundred a trucks have now crossed into Gaza , but agencies say they still do n't have clearance to retrieve and distribute it . So most of the development minister on a visit to the West Bank today said Israel was using hunger as a weapon of war . We just can not stand by and allow millions of people to be starved to death to when it 's a choice . This is n't a natural disaster . It has n't been an earthquake or a volcanic eruption . And this is a decision that 's being made by a small group of politicians to stop families and children from having the food that they need . Views of Gaza 's destruction have damaged views of Israel , too . Mr. Netanyahu said Britain was under pressure from its Muslim minority and from what he called fake propaganda from Hamas . Criticism and consequences are now the language of allies . A trickle of aid will do little to ease the pressure of Gaza 's hunger , nor the pressure of allies horrified by Israel 's plans . That report was by Lucy Williamson ."

The court gave the American musician permission to continue with his scheduled international tour which includes UK shows in June and July . Let 's speak to our news correspondent Greg McKenzie who 's been following this story throughout . Greg , good to see you . What were the conditions of bail ? , there were strict conditions , Lucy , in terms of the bail that was granted today in a London court , Southern Crown Court . Now , just in terms of background , Chris Brown was arrested last Thursday in Manchester in the early hours of the morning by Metropolitan Police officers who were tipped off that the singer had arrived in the UK . Now , he was wanted for questioning in relation to an assault in a nightclub 2 years ago in London . So , the singer had flown in to Manchester on his private jet to work on preparations for his tour . He has a number of UK dates and it was then that the police arrested him last Thursday at 2:00 in the morning . He went to court the following morning and the judge said that he was not going to grant the singer bail and he was subsequently held on remand in a UK prison , we believe in a Manchester prison . Now today his lawyers have submitted successfully a bail application and the judge at Sod Crown Court has granted that bail for the singer on the condition that the singer pays £ 4 million upfront and a further 1 million in the next week . Now that is really a security deposit if you . So that if the singer breaks any of the conditions of that bow condition , then he would forfeit the £ 5 million in total . Now , as for other conditions that have been stipulated , the judge has said that he will allow Chris Brown to carry on with his UK tour date . So he 's due in Manchester , London , Cardiff , Birmingham , and Glasgow , and also other dates in the US and Canada . The judge has said he will allow the singer to travel internationally , but he must provide an address here in the UK where he must reside until his next court appearance on June the 20th . And briefly , Greg , we 're seeing pictures of Chris Brown at the moment on tour . He 's won a few Grammys . Tell us a bit more about his career and why he 's so popular . , Chris Brown is an international platinum selling artist . He 's had numbers and numbers of number one hits and an artist that has been in the industry for a number of decades and many people have watched him grow from a child to a man and be quite successful . He 's had a few issues in the past which were widely reported . most famously the incident with Rihanna back in 2010 and subsequently he had spent some time had got prosecuted for that back in Los Angeles many years ago but moving forward the singer had apologized and has seemed to be getting his life back on track and this incident two years ago . He 's yet to answer to those charges or even enter a plea , but it 's widely expected on June the 20th when he appears at SDK mag Crown Court that he will submit a plea and he will appear in court on the 20th of June along with his codefendant Omalulu Akin Lolu who is a music producer . Both the pair or the pair are accused of attacking a fellow music producer at a London nightclub two years ago . Greg , thank you so much . Good to see you .

Let 's show you a map of what is the exclusive economic zones of each country as defined by the United Nations . But it 's China which claims most of the South China Sea as shown here . It 's been building military bases and sending hundreds of ships to enforce its claims . Few countries have challenged it , but the Philippines has , and reinforcing the few reefs and islands it holds . The most important of these is the tiny island of Pagasa , halfway between the Philippines and Vietnam . Our Southeast Asia correspondent , Jonathan Head , was allowed a rare visit to the island . We 've been flying for an hour over an empty sea . Now we saw coral reefs and began looking for the speck of an island the Philippines calls Pagasa or Hope . A flotilla of Chinese ships told us we were close . They 're a permanent intimidating presence . Less than a kilometer wide , Pagasa has barely enough runway for our plane to land . But the Philippines is now building it up with troops and new infrastructure . A small bastion of defiance against China . So here we are on Pagasa and as you can see there really is n't very much to it . In fact , I think you could probably walk all the way around the island in about 30 minutes . But it is solid land , a proper island , unlike the submerged reefs characteristic of this area . And it does have a civilian population . All helping to reinforce the claims of the Philippines against those of its giant neighbor . But living here is tough and very isolated . Around 300 people call this island home . There 's a school and a clinic , but not much else . Residents depend on government support food rations . Though those we spoke to all said they liked the clean and quiet environment . . The main challenge is when people , especially children , get sick . When it 's a serious case , we need to evacuate them quickly to the mainland . But planes are not always available . And sometimes the weather is too rough . Aside from government jobs , fishing is the only viable way to make a living . But that 's become much more difficult since the swarms of Chinese ships arrived offshore , harassing the little Filipino boats . Those Chinese are not fishermen . Their ships are huge compared to our small wooden boats . Their threaten us coming close and sing their horns two she s away . Because of that , we can only fish close to the island and the fish stalks here are much smaller . If it 's to prevent a complete Chinese takeover in this area , the Philippines needs to hold on to this sliver of land . Its forces are outnumbered and outgunned . But after years of watching China expand its presence in these seas , there is a renewed determination in the Philippines not to retreat any further . Jonathan Head , BBC News on Pagasa Island ."
https://youtu.be/FvsyPSyCzKA?si=CdO-PS2powfoZCMZ,Donald Trump unveils plans for ‘Golden Dome’ defence system,BBC news,FvsyPSyCzKA,"A US President Donald Trump has unveiled the design for a new missile defense system for the United States that he 's calling the Golden Dome . He said it would be able to intercept attacks launched from space and claimed it would be up and running before he leaves office in 2029 . The president said the final cost of the project would be 175 billion . Our North America correspondent Peter Bose told me more about the proposal . This is Donald Trump 's plan to essentially futureproof the United States from potential attacks from its adversaries and it is looking ahead . It is looking at the potential developments in terms of missile technology and the way that the United States could be attacked from targets well from targets that pointed out from the earth and from space and that 's the significant difference targets in United States may be traditional in a certain sense but the way in which the adversaries will use technology with weapons that essentially fired from space is going to be the future and you 'll get many defense experts who say that this is how Donald Trump and other world leaders should be looking at defense for the future . The big question is Donald Trump being overly ambitious . This seems to be molded on Israel 's Iron Dome which of course is designed and has been used for some time now to prevent short range attacks in a relatively small country . The United States is of course very different . This is a vast expanse of land , at least mainland America , and the technology required , especially to get the hardware into space , is going to be tremendously sophisticated . And some critics say that President Trump wo n't be able to achieve it in the three and a half years that he 's spelled out ."
https://youtu.be/cLdmFDMdoHI?si=OUPdYBjieFlB3O_o,Electric cars make up 20% of UK car sales in 2024,BBC news,cLdmFDMdoHI,"There are 5 years to go until the government will begin to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in the UK . The car industry is adapting and the majority of new models being put onto the market now have either fully electric or hybrid engines . But last year they made up just 20 % of all car sales . Our climate editor Justin Rolot has been investigating why . Just look at the scale of this . Car companies have brought dozens of cars and there are miles of track here at Milbrook Proving Ground to put them through their paces at the 2025 SMMT event here . But something 's missing , is n't it ? Have a listen . No roaring engines . Every wannabe Clarkson in British journalism is almost certainly here . But here 's an interesting fact . The car industry has brought 154 models to this show . 103 of them are either fully electric or hybrid . So what 's that ? Two out of every three . It is a measure of just how invested the industry is in the electric future . Mike Halls is the head of the UK 's Society of Motor Industry Manufacturers and Traders . You look at the investment the industry has made over the last 10 years . It has all been in electrification . They 're trying not to develop petrol and diesel because they see those coming to a natural end . So the market , the industry is moving towards zero emission vehicles . What we need to make sure is the market follows it . So take a look at what 's on offer . Have a look at this . There are some pretty tasty electric cars on sale here , but lots of us just are n't convinced . So last year , 20 % of cars sold were electric vehicles . Quite a few more were hybrids , but that is still well below the 28 % target the government set . So what is the problems ? There are still so many people out there who think that EVs do n't go far enough , they 're too expensive , they burst into flames , etc . , etc . , all those questions are answered these days , but it 's a big leap of faith and the most important thing is to get thumbs on seats , make sure people can live with these things and they experience them , but it 's difficult to persuade people , particularly in the current climate . But of course , there is another issue . The price . Electric cars have tended to be more expensive than petrol and diesel , but prices are falling . Take a look at this little city runaround . 16 grand it will cost you and it 'll do about 165 miles on a charge . For a couple of grand more , probably talking more 200 miles . So , let 's take it for a spin . Let 's see what this thing can do . Even if the ticket price is a bit higher than petrol or diesel , on average , an EV driver is reckoned to save hundreds of pounds a year in running costs . And the average range is now around 300 miles . Got to try a top of the range EV as well . I 've got to say though , I 'm a bit nervous about this one . Woohoo ! The car industry claims it has spent hundreds of millions of pounds funding the switch over to EVs by selling them here in the UK at discount prices . Now it wants government help . I think that the government needs to put in more incentives really to get us out of petrol diesel cars into electric cars . Make electric cars cheaper , the industry says , by cutting VAT on new EVs and on the costs of public charging . But with so little money to play with , the government is unlikely to do that , which could make the UK 's ambitious EV targets hard to achieve . And there is another challenge . Be honest . Would you ever switch fully to an electric vehicle ? I 'm still in the half electric , half petrol , half diesel camp . Also , I love sound . I love annoy . I love the noise of a big engine , a pop banging exhaust , and I love a manual gearbox . It seems the UK is well on the road to fully electric motoring , but it may just take a bit longer than the government and the industry was hoping ."

Campaigners are renewing their calls for the government to issue a formal apology as events take place to commemorate those affected including a former home for unmarried mothers in Cornwall from where Tams in Melville sent this report . That is all I 've had for 50 years . It was 1956 when a 19 - year - old Lynn Roden from Campborn gave birth to her son at Rose Mundy Mother and Baby Home . But I had to get on a train and take my son up to Bath and leave him in an office . Woman just came out said name and told her I 'll take the baby , she said . And she took him into the back office . Came out said hurry up . She said , "" Catch your train . "" She said , "" , I 'm back to St. Agnes . She 'll be there for another 6 weeks . "" That was it . Cried all the way home . Eventually reunited with her son 50 years later . For Lynn , a public plaque means everything . It was awful here . It really was awful . And it 's lived with me all my life . I 'm sorry . Gathered at what is now a hotel were mothers , adopes , and relatives from across the country who are survivors of forced adoptions at various unmarried mother 's homes . Now living in Yuki , Suzanne Postings was adopted in 1970 from a home in Shroptshire . , I 'm 55 now . I 've never seen or heard of anything that 's that 's giving recognition to what the women went through , what the families went through , what the children went through . Roger was born here in 1953 and adopted by a family in Hail at 6 weeks old . He says babies were lined up under this tree . They used to push the prams out in the morning and people used to come and choose you . So it 's a bit barbaric the way they did it , but that 's the way it was . I think it was n't everyone , but it was common for young mothers to be pressurized into giving up their babies . The driving force behind this first ever public recognition is Phil Frampton . born here in 1953 followed by years in foster care . It was a terrible time and the government needs to recognize its role and apologize . It 's really time you acted and when the plaque I hope you 'll have a second thought or even hang your head in shame that you 've not acted and left the people to do it . If Canada , Australia , all over the world , Wales and Scotland can say sorry , why ca n't these politicians use it ? It 's a dirty fiveletter word to them . A Department for Education spokesperson said , "" This aborant practice should never have taken place and our deepest sympathies are with all those affected . We take this issue extremely seriously .

At 23 years old , I had a very clear crossroads . There was one of two ways I could have gone . I could have turned to things drugs and alcohol to numb my pain .

https://youtu.be/L25UVsxuMUg?si=xM_NSHDUVvE-q1rL,Scientists race to discover why our Universe exists,BBC news,L25UVsxuMUg,"Researchers in the US have begun building a new particle detector that they hope will help find an answer to a very big question . Just why does the universe exist ? The project is known as the deep underground neutrino experiment or DUNE for short . And we 'll study subatomic particles . Let 's speak to Dr. Mark Scott , senior lecturer in neutrino physics at Imperial College London . Dr. Scott , thank you very much for joining us . We 've got two projects that we need to talk about , one American , one Japanese . Let 's start with how the science works behind what you 're trying to discover in words of one or two syllables if you can . I 'll try my best . Thank you . so , we 're studying a fundamental particle known as nutrino . And it comes in three different types , things we call flavors . So we have electron , muon , and tow type nutrinos . Now these experiments , the one in the US and HyperK , the one I work on in Japan , we create very powerful beams of nutrinos and fire them hundreds of kilometers . And when we create these beams , as they travel , the nutrinos change between these three different types . so a muon nutrino may change into an electron nutrino for instance . and what the experiments are looking for is very subtle differences between how matter nutrinos change compared to antimatter nutrinos . and if we see that these are different , it might tell us why the universe we live in appears to be dominated by matter rather than antimatter . Why does it have to be so far underground ? We 're seeing pictures of the tunneling that 's had to go on to enable this to happen . So the detectors are very sensitive . They 're looking for extremely rare and extremely low energy events . And the Earth is surrounded by an atmosphere and it 's continually bombarded with particles mainly from the sun but also from elsewhere in our solar system . these particles are raining down on us on the surface of the planet . And so if we built our detectors on the surface , they would just be swamped by this background . we call them cosmic rays and so we dig them underground and put usually a mountain on top if we can to shield ourselves from this . How is it then that the Japanese - led hyper project is ahead of the American June project ? , this is an interesting question . So the two collaborations made decisions early on in the design of their experiments . and the Japanese group HyperK chose to use water detectors as their technology . whereas the US - led group Dune uses liquid argon . so liquid argon is very nice . It gives you a very detailed look at what 's happening in your experiment but it 's very hard to get a large volume of liquid argon and so they had to do a lot more development of their detector whereas the water technology used in Japan was well understood and it 's much easier to make a larger detector . so the design for hyper cameo cande has I think 225,000 tons of water whereas the design for dune has 40,000 tons of liquid argon so roughly five and a half times bigger . they do n't they do n't call it a space race for nothing I suppose and it 's an apt description on this occasion . Dr. Mark Scott from Imperial College London thank you very much for taking us gently through the science . Thank you . Thank you ."

And that 's precisely what the Kremlin wants to continue , the status quo . In fact , the American president appears to have reversed his earlier insistence that a ceasefire must precede any talks . Now he 's saying , "" , let 's talk first and then think about a ceasefire . "" Also , he has ruled out fresh sanctions on Russia for now . Again , that 's precisely what Vladimir Putin wants . And he 's still threatening to walk out of the whole process . And I 'm sure Vladimir Putin would not mind that either especially if that means no more American aid for Ukraine . So from the point of view of bringing peace closer conversation between the American and Russian presidents and the talks in Istanbul last Friday , I think they can be described as fruitless . So , Vladimir Putin 's not won over by Donald Trump 's personality and his dealmaking persona . , Vladimir Putin is playing his own game and looking at what he 's been saying and doing in Ukraine . I think he 's still determined to conquer Ukraine . Russian officials , they keep saying that they need what they call the root causes of the crisis to be addressed . And translated from Kremlin speak , this means the very reasons why Russia started this war in the first place , which is to stop Ukraine exercising its sovereignty and stop being an independent state . And how strong is the war machine still in Moscow ? How long can factories keep on churning out what Russia needs and recruitment centers finding people to send to the front line ? , it appears to be strong enough for this to continue . They 're still turnurning out drones and artillery shells and missiles . the Russian army is held by its allies such as North Korea and Iran . oil prices are lower but not low enough to the Russian economy . And also the Kremlin 's war machine is to a large extent as strong as it 's allowed to be . And I 'm sure Ukraine has reason to be disappointed with some of its allies in Europe as well . you will remember of course that it 's it 's more than a week since the deadline they set for Russia to cease fire on the 12th of May last Monday . It 's it 's been and gone . And despite threats to impose crippling sanctions on Russia , that 's not happened yet . So Vladimir Putin can see that as an invitation to keep on attacking Ukraine . empty threats . history shows that they do n't really get us anywhere with Vladimir Putin . , I understand the EU may approve its next 17th package of sanctions on Russia . Let 's see how effective they 're going to"

The decision comes after pressure from the United States . Further Israeli ground operations have also taken place today across Gaza with deadly air strikes continuing . Hospitals say at least 100 people , including dozens of children , have been killed in the last 24 hours . Let 's go to the border between southern Israel and Gaza . Our Middle East correspondent Wura Davis is there and we 're just in the last few moments the Israeli military has said five trucks carrying aid have entered Gaza but of course as the UN chief also saying that is simply a drop in the ocean . , five trucks carrying aid there apparently baby food and other vital aid . It is a drop in the ocean . a UN spokeswoman told me this morning that 5 to 600 trucks a day would be needed to even start to alleviate and address the problems of malnutrition and shortages that Gaza 's 2.1 million people face . So I think they 'll be apart from laughing this is a very serious matter . Five trucks are going to make absolutely no difference at all . the UN has already hit back today saying that much more aid is needed and that must be facilitated via the existing UN staff and various UN bodies because that is the only way this aid is going to make a difference . Earlier today we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . He admitted that Israel has been widely criticized even by its closest ally the United States . , Israel was warned not to cross a red line and allow starvation to be a big problem in Gaza , but if Mitt Netanyahu 's answer is to allow as small as five trucks a day in , then I do n't think he can expect there not to be any more criticism . So perhaps Israel is intending to ramp this up over coming days , but this is a very small answer to what Gaza 's overwhelming needs are and it wo n't satisfy his allies internationally . That 's for sure . We 're bringing up to date in terms of the military operation . We 've been seeing for a number of days now . [ Music ] , you can probably hear in the distance you we 've been hearing and seeing all day the impact of Israeli artillery and air strikes on Gaza , much of northern Gaza behind me . Bet Hanoon , Gaza City , Jabalia , they 've all been hit relentlessly throughout the day . You can hear sometime or you can see sometimes the smoke in the distance as those buildings are hit . What you can also see are the trails of dust as Israeli armor moves towards Gaza City . this is the start or the continuation if you of Operation Gideon 's chariots . It 's Israel again according to Benjamin Netanyahu occupying the whole of Gaza . they 're going to defeat Hamas completely . That is the Israeli military aim . And a big and controversial part of that plan is to move much of Gaza 's population , hundreds of thousands of people southwards towards relocation centers in the south . But that military operation very much underway as we speak . Wor Davis there on the border . Thanks very much indeed for the"

Age 15 , she was about to make Olympic history . History has been made here . Youngest ever to win the event . Lithuania get their first medal . It 's a gold . How special is this for you ? It 's too much for me . In 2010 , she joined Plymouth Leander , one of the most successful swimming clubs in the UK . She was trained by head coach John Rudd , credited with turning the club into a medalinning powerhouse . She has an inner drive and an intrinsic desire for success . But behind John Rudd 's success was a darker side . We 've spoken to eight swimmers trained by Rudd , including Rout . They all described pressure over their diet and weight , with some making themselves sick to get thinner . John said , "" My ass is fat . "" in one competition when I was 16 . I broke a world record that day . I think that was because I was angry . We 've seen a review of a confidential independent investigation by Swim England in 2012 . 17 witnesses gave evidence about John Rudd 's behavior . The investigation found that under RD 's leadership , swimmers were , as Swim England described it , publicly fat shamed , verbally abused , made to train while injured , inappropriately disciplined , and that there was a bullying culture . It recommended he be suspended for 4 months . He never was . We 've made numerous attempts to contact John Rudd about our investigation . He has n't responded . Rebecca Adlington won gold in the 2008 Beijing Olympics , age 19 . The reason why I think I was so successful is because my coach ultimately always saw me as a human being first . Other coaches would try and see how much they could burn their athlete out or push them or shout at them . My coach did none of that . In swimming , I have to acknowledge you are very exposed . I love the sport so much , but one big downside is body image . And even now , 36 and people think I 'm super confident at putting a costume on . I am not . Plymouth Leander is under new leadership and says it ca n't comment on historical incidents or decisions . It says it carried out a thorough review of its safeguarding policies and procedures to provide the safest possible environment . The club says John Rudd was employed directly by Plymouth College which they were partnered with at the time and it was responsible for his oversight . Plymouth College says the club was responsible for safeguarding . It says excellence should never come at the cost of individual well - being and that it 's deeply concerned to hear these swimmers testimonies . The failures of the investigation into road have led Swim England to review 1,500 safeguarding cases across England stretching back 20 years . Swim England now says it 's determined to learn from past mistakes . What would you say to all those children who have suffered as a result of failings within Swim England ? I would say , I 'm sorry . We absolutely wish that you had n't endured the poor experience that you did endure . So deeply , deeply sorry for that . Rebecca Woods , BBC News ."
https://youtu.be/2qkN1vAI5pI?si=znq_Y0-fQJlmx13A,Child exploitation uncovered in illegal mines in South Africa,BBC news,2qkN1vAI5pI,"Now , a BBC investigation has uncovered evidence that children as young as 15 are being trafficked into illegal minds and sexually abused across South Africa . Several eyewitnesses have described repeated instances of sexual abuse of children in at least three illegal mines . Our Africa correspondent Miami Jones sent this report from Johannesburg and some viewers might find the testimony in this report distressing . A doorway to hell . This abandoned shaft near the town of Still Fontaine was one of the largest illegal mines in South Africa . Late last year , footage emerged of hundreds of bodies underground . The surviving miners claimed they could n't escape after the police sealed some of the exits and tried to force them out by limiting the supply of food and water . The BBC has confirmed that more than 30 of the trapped miners were children . Eyewitnesses described desperate conditions in the mine , including widespread starvation and illness . But more horrors took place on the ground . Workers from Save the Children South Africa translated interviews for some of the underage miners . The children that we spoke to did report sexual exploitation . The trauma that they had gone through because some of them saw others being sexually exploited . , just the feeling that I may not come out of here destroyed those children mentally . Reports of abuse are not limited to Still Fontaine . Men who worked in two other illegal mines have told the BBC they witnessed child abuse on the ground . Sele is a former illegal minor . We 've protected his identity for fear of retribution . I 've seen elderly men forcing young boys to have sex with them underground against their will . And can you tell me what impact this abuse had on the children ? They change their behavior pattern and have trust issues . They no longer want you to get any closer to them because they feel that they no longer trust anyone around them . I was a bit scared . Jonathan worked in another mine near Johannesburg . Sometimes I used to see kids entering mining . So they used to take advantage of them sometimes . How old were these kids ? 15 , 17 . And what was being done to them ? Sexual abuse . whenever they get a chance , , they used to promise them sometimes say , , I 'll give you God and , , I need your body . If that kid is desperate of money , they will take the risk . Researchers say these children are trafficked from poor families in neighboring countries and promised employment in formal mines . Others are abducted and forced to work . Mining has long been central to South Africa 's economy . Johannesburg was built on gold mines in the 19th century , and there are still mine dumps these everywhere . But declining prices has led to the closure of thousands of formal mines , leaving many shafts empty and fueling an illegal industry that 's dangerous and rife with abuse . Most of the children rescued from Still Fontaine were foreign nationals and have been deported . But the illegal mining industry continues to thrive . And with an estimated 6,000 vacant mines potentially available to explore , it 's a business that 's unlikely to end anytime soon , leaving thousands of vulnerable children at risk . Mine Jones , BBC News , Johannesburg . And the BBC did ask the police and Department of Social Development whether anyone would be charged over the sexual abuse allegations . They did not respond to our requests ."
https://youtu.be/1fzcXnDxiAo?si=CfxgCSfNPDiMKiKQ,Israel to allow ‘basic amount’ of aid into Gaza,BBC news,1fzcXnDxiAo,"Israel says it will allow a basic amount of food aid into Gaza , ending a 10 - week blockade that has brought the territory to the brink of famine . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the onset of a starvation crisis would jeopardize its renewed military offensive against Hamas . , extensive ground operations have started throughout the south and the north of the territory where air strikes have reportedly put all three public hospitals out of action . More than 100 Palestinians are reported to have been killed in the past 24 hours . A little earlier , I spoke to our Middle East correspondent , Yolanda . We do n't know at the moment when exactly aid will get into Gaza or how but we had this statement that came through from the Israeli prime minister 's office saying a decision had been reached in cabinet that a basic quantity of food aid would be allowed into Gaza . that Israel would work to ensure that this aid did not reach Hamas . Of course , that has been the accusation by Israel as it said it was imposing a blockade on Gaza 11 weeks ago , saying this was to pressure Hamas , accusing it of having stolen supplies , something Hamas denied . And we had the UN and other aid agencies coming out saying they had strong supervision mechanisms . But this all comes against the background of rising international condemnation of Israel 's position . We had a pressure coming from the US as well . And we had , , in the past week or so increased warnings that famine was looming in the Gaza Strip . So the Israeli prime minister 's office said that a starvation crisis would jeopardize Israel 's new military offensive which began just a couple of days ago in Gaza . We have only had from the UN a comment that it has been asked to resume its deliveries into Gaza . Of course , we had been told there 's something 116,000 metric tons of food aid standing by at Gaza 's crossings if only they would reopen . But for the moment , Israel does also seem to be looking to introducing this very controversial new aid mechanism in the future . So , it 's making clear that it will only allow the UN to resume its operations as a temporary measure . Of course , the UN and its humanitarian partners have said that the new system that Israel is looking to introduce is both unethical and unworkable . And Yoland , just briefly , you mentioned their Israel 's military offensive . Just talk us through where things stand with that . , one day ago , we had Israel 's military announcing these new ground operations . They 're concentrated in the north and the south of the Gaza Strip as part of this intense new offensive that it 's begun there . we 've been hearing this morning about intense bombardments of Ununice . There are videos that show some of these strikes . places the Nusa Hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip have been involved . also a school that we 're told had been housing displaced children as well . Palestinian media reporting that at least six people have been killed . In the past day , we heard of more than 100 people being killed according to hospitals . this across the Gaza Strip with dozens of children among the dead . We still have negotiating teams for both Israel and Hamas in Qatar for these indirect talks , but at the moment we 're not hearing of any signs of a breakthrough from there in terms of getting to a new ceasefire deal that could see Israel 's remaining hostages being freed from Gaza ."

A statement from his office said that Mr. Biden , who 's 82 , was given the diagnosis on Friday and has an aggressive form of the disease . Let 's get the latest from our North America correspondent Jake Quan . And this has only emerged in the last hour or so , Jake . So , how much do we know ? So this is a breaking news and we have very little information that was shared by the Biden some former president Joe Biden 's office and they say that on a on a checkup in the biopsy they have found a prostate cancer something that they see as some of a more aggressive form of cancer and that it has metastasized to the bone . A few weeks ago Mr. Biden was having some urinary problems increasingly and then he has gone into the hospital to get it checked out and they have found a little small nodule , a little bump in his prostate . and last week he had a biopsy and past Friday they have finally diagnosed that it was in fact cancer cell that has metastasized to the bone . this does not bode well for a prognosis . In fact , when a cancer moves to the bone , usually it means it is incurable . the treatment will be very challenging . And Mr. Biden is currently 82 years old . and Mr. Biden 's family I 'm sure they 're having a discussion with him and as well as the doctors trying to find the treatment options . And one thing that they said in the statement is that the cancer cell seems to be responding to hormones and that there that gives some hope to treatment . so this is all this a conversation I 'm sure Mr. Biden and his family are having with the doctors and they will be looking at treatment options as well .

https://youtu.be/Nsazxy2Ori8?si=6lbV7Ua-t8J1CnH7,Fresh ceasefire talks after new Israel offensive in Gaza ,BBC news,Nsazxy2Ori8,"Hamas has proposed releasing more hostages under a new Gaza ceasefire deal . It 's after new negotiations were held on Saturday . Nine hostages would be released in exchange for a 60 - day truce and Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners . Israel is yet to respond publicly to the deal . Israel has continued a major new offensive in Gaza named Operation Gideon 's Chariots . Local officials say some 300 people have been killed since Thursday , including 58 who died in air strikes on Saturday . , let 's speak to our correspondent in Jerusalem , Wira Davies . , we 're what else do about this new deal ? , look , the deal has n't been struck yet , and there are a few concrete details coming out of Qatar , but that 's perhaps no bad thing . There appear to be a few points on which both sides seem to be agreed . that 's according to what the BBC understands . Hamas would release nine of the remaining hostages who are still alive in exchange for a 60 - day truce . Also , a number of Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails . And critically , because of the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza , around 400 trucks of aid would be allowed in every day as well as part of the deal . those are the things that perhaps both sides can agree on . are significant sticking points . The biggest one seems to be would there be a negotiated end to the war as part of the ceasefire deal or would Israel as they did after the last ceasefire agreement would Israel resume the fighting and its attacks on Gaza ? That appears to be the biggest problem . Israel has always maintained the to continue the war in Gaza to defeat Hamas . Hamas negotiators seem to want some agreement to work towards an end of the war as part of the deal . Meanwhile , as the peace talks continue , there 's been no letup in the fighting in Gaza . Israel is continuing with this big new offensive . There were reported attacks in southern Gaza and Alawasi overnight . And that is significant because Amawasi was designated as a safe area earlier on in the war . Somewhere to where Palestinians displaced from their homes because of the fighting could go in relative safety . But on several occasions , of course , the area has been hit in Israeli air strikes . Israel says it 's attacking Hamas positions , but it 's clear that several Palestinians have been killed in those Israeli attacks over recent days . But the big fear of course is if those talks in Qatar do not come up with an agreement that Israel has said it will go ahead with this big enhanced military push into Gaza , Operation Gideon 's Chariots that would involve a significant escalation of the military operation in Gaza . Just briefly , this deal comes off the back of significant loss of life in Gaza in recent days , has n't it ? And just how intense have the strikes been this week ? . . Throughout the week , Israel has been stepping up the intensification of its air strikes across Gaza . On Friday we had perhaps the biggest Israeli military incursion from land , sea , and air into northern Gaza . I think that was a portent of things to come . Israel clearly indicating as it has threatened to do many times in recent weeks that this big enhanced military operation with thousands of reserve soldiers that has already started and I think it will again as I say it will step up if the peace talks in if the ceasefire talks in Doha fail . We 're Davis there . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/6dUDjbvxpMA?si=2CoFkS_H0HGbEEY2,"Russian drone attack on Ukraine bus kills nine, officials say",BBC news,6dUDjbvxpMA,", I 'm Emma Vardy . Let 's start this hour with some breaking news . Nine people have been killed in a Russian drone strike on a passenger bus in northeastern Ukraine . That 's according to local officials . The Sunumi regional administration says another four people were injured in the town of Bilapia on Saturday morning . The reported attack comes just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022 . Let 's speak now to our Ukraine correspondent , James Waterhouse , who 's in Kev . James , what do more do we know about this strike ? , the police in the Sunumi region have posted some pretty disturbing images of a mangled minibus where there is blood on the floor along the side of a road and they say that it was packed full of passengers making its way from the border towards the northeastern city of Sunumi itself . They say it was struck by a Russian drone . these piloted what these remotec controlled drones that are frequently aimed at civilians across border towns and settlements or even on the front line . Sunumi 's had a pretty tough time of it over the past couple of months when it comes to missile and drone attacks from attacking Russian forces . What Moscow is claiming on this occasion is that it struck a weapons loading area , a preparation area used by Ukrainian forces , but we 've yet to see any evidence accompany that claim . So , a very difficult morning in Ukraine 's northeast today . And this coming off the back so soon after those peace talks between Ukraine and Russia . What effect might this have on that process ? I think we 're talking about a process whilst diplomatically significant . , it is true that it 's the first time in more than three years that Ukrainian and Russian officials stared each other in the eye and tried to negotiate some end to the fighting . There were areas of agreement when it came to a large prisoner exchange , a thousand by each side . Now , there are preparations taking place , we understand , already for that to happen . But when it comes to a ceasefire itself , I do n't think we are any closer . , the Russian delegation in Turkey has been accused again of demanding the complete control of four Ukrainian provinces . , that would equate to the handing over sways of territory and major cities that Russia has been unable to take in all the years of fighting so far and Ukraine simply wo n't go for it . Now , Voladim Zilinski 's had his European allies put an arm around him once more . the likes of Donald Tusk of Poland , Emanuel Macarron of France and Sakir Stalmer of the UK , they are now saying they still hope that Vladimir Zilinski and Vladimir Putin of Russia could still meet . Moscow says it is it has noted that request . but Vladimir Putin has been accused of merely buying time , trying to take part in these peace talks to stall further sanctions , economic punishments which are being prepared by Ukraine 's European allies as well this week . as these attempted peace talks really do for Ukraine drag on . What do you think it would take the steps that would be needed to get to direct peace talks between Zalinski and Putin ? I think it would take a catalyst in the shape of Donald Trump . at the moment we know he is impatient . and it is the military might of America which determines the course and direction of this war for Ukraine . That is an inescapable fact . but I think you have what we have seen so far is President Trump pressure Ukraine more than he has pressured Russia . Ukraine has had to demonstrate to show that it is fully willing to engage in some peace process . That is why you saw Volidimir Zalinski in Turkey this week . He did cut an isolated figure in the absence of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin . But that is what Ukraine is trying to do . But I think for both Ukraine and Russia to engage in meaty , meaningful discussions , I think there will have to be some pressure , you would imagine , applied on the Kremlin by America . What could that be ? Could that be more military aid for Ukraine ? Could that be further sanctions , which the US president hinted at in the past ? Ukraine certainly hopes so . I think what Ukraine does n't have is any military pressure to apply to Russia . That window has gone . Russia is firmly keeping hold of the territory it has brutally seized . and it is continuing to take more notably in the on the vast eastern front lines of this"

President Trump says the refugee applications were expedited because the people concerned were victims of racial discrimination , something South Africa 's government denies . The Africanas are descended from Dutch settlers who arrived four centuries ago to South Africa and who led the government which brought in apartheite , a racially segregated political system which has led to discrimination against black South Africans and it 's no longer in force . , usually it takes years for the US government to process refugee applications , but this group waited only three months . , our North America correspondent Nomiabar has been speaking to one of those who made the journey .

https://youtu.be/tKGACjDIm_8?si=U3bBALMQGoelkRqf,Ukraine and Russia agree to prisoner swap after peace talks,BBC news,tKGACjDIm_8,"Now , direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations have been taking place in Istanbul today , the first such meeting between the waring parties in over three years . There were no handshakes and the expectations were low . There was no significant progress today , although both sides have agreed on another prisoner swap , but no ceasefire and nothing that changes the status quo . Donald Trump , of course , saying yesterday that there 'd only be progress when he and Vladimir Putin meet . , Ukraine 's defense minister spoke outside of the talks in the last half an hour . We have agreed to exchange thousand persons to thousand and we 're working on other modalities and our colleagues are in contact and will exchange all the documents . Thank you minister just one question if it 's possible what is the next step for the meetings after that what we need to expect now . So now we need to exchange people and soon we will inform you what is the next stage . Thank you so much . , let me bring you the latest from of course all those leaders that have also been speaking in the last little while . President Zilinski has had a call with Donald Trump and said Ukraine is ready for quick steps for peace . He said robust sanctions should follow if Russia rejects the ceasefire . President Macron has also said it 's unacceptable for Russia to again ignore Ukrainian ceasefire calls and that was a line also agreed with by Zaki Star the British prime minister . So those from the leaders in the last half an hour as well let 's speak to Sergey Rajenko who is the professor at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies . Thank you for being here with us . What is your analysis of what has been happening there in Istanbul ? , , it 's the expected . It 's a first meeting . The sides expressed their initial positions and now they will take those positions back to Moscow and Kiev and see if there 's any give and take . What I understand as the next step in addition to the prisoner exchange which of course is a positive development is that the two sides will consider ways of achieving a ceasefire and will exchange ideas to this effect which may be then followed by another round of talks or I hope it will be followed by another round of talks . A little earlier , Ukrainian diplomats were saying that the Russian delegation had demanded that Ukraine withdraws forces from its territory to get that ceasefire . That was described as totally unacceptable and an attempt to derail these talks . Is the Russian strategy , do you think , just that long game just continue to delay and delay and delay ? Not necessarily , but the Russians have been saying that they want to approach these talks and peace negotiations from the position of reality . What they however have failed to recognize is that the reality is that they have not been able to claim the territories that Russia has formally annexed . 25 % of Zaparisia remain out of reach for the Russians . They 're stuck in eastern Ukraine . So if we recognize those realities , then we will have to have a ceasefire along the existing lines . And I think it 's wise for the Ukrainians to reject preposterous demands by the Russians to remove Ukrainian forces from the territory that Russia has failed to conquer . A twin final thought . In the old world order , there would be deadlines and then if the actions were n't taken , then the various threats would be imposed . We keep seeing in the new world order with Donald Trump , no line in the sand . So your thoughts on that and another thought to weave in . Is Vladimir Putin 's strategy working ? Because you heard Donald Trump say yesterday , "" This only moves when Putin and I meet . "" That of course sidelines Ukraine itself and the Europeans . , Putin would love to have that meeting with Trump and to get Trump to arm twist President Zalinski into agreeing to demands from Russia that he would otherwise not agree to . , now is Putin winning ? , I do n't think so . At the moment , Russia is bogged down in Eastern Ukraine . The war has taken on a very attritional character . , as for peace talks , they can go on for a long time . There are no deadlines . Peace talks in previous wars , think about the Vietnam war , the war of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , lasted for years and years before a settlement was achieved . But the issue here is Donald Trump is a very impatient man and he wants quick results . Now , he 's not getting those results judging from what we just saw in Istanbul . , of course , peace talks will take many , many months , if not longer . But the initial stage , the ceasefire stage , that is what continues to elude those parties on the ground , certainly the Ukrainians . Thanks very much . We will leave it there . So sero , thanks for joining us on the program . Thank you ."

https://youtu.be/1zNabmYO-DY?si=TwQRm88orzBqr-bx,US 'troubled' by humanitarian situation in Gaza after Israeli air strikes,BBC news,1zNabmYO-DY,", the US Secretary of State says that the Trump administration was troubled by the humanitarian situation in Gaza , reeling under a total Israeli blockade . He spoke as at least 120 Palestinians were reported killed in Israeli air strikes since Thursday . Israel says it 's targeting Hamas and that it 'll continue with plans to expand its offensive in the territory over the coming days . Though many victims were women and children in displacement camps , Israel says that the strikes were against legitimate militant targets . Muhammad Taha is from BBC Arabic and he has more on the Israeli strikes that continue across Gaza . In Gaza on the south in Kunis and Rafa and on the north in Jabalia Beta and Betanoon and I can say comfortably Lquisa that however Israel announced that they will start expanding the military operation in Gaza on Sunday . This expansion started from last night . So reports are coming from Gaza from the north are telling us that the Israel ground forces are advancing towards Jabalia Baha . They are asking the women to be separated from men , arresting some men and then expanding the operation this way asking the people to evacuate the north including Alshifa hospital north in the city of Gaza and the Islamic university in the north as well where there are many displaced people are there . some of the descriptions on social media and also being reported of the results of those strikes are really quite upsetting particularly on the medical camp . What has the United States Marco Rubio said on this matter so far ? Indeed . He said that the United States is troubled . But apparently troubled is not enough as the United States this trouble that the United States is feeling is not pushing them to take a tougher stance towards the Israeli Prime Minister Binam Netanyahu and his willingness to continue this war without any hope to reach ceasefire to release the hostages . So and amongst the Trump visit to the Middle East , we did n't see any big announcement regarding Gaza . We saw big announcement regarding Syria , the lifting of the sanctions or the or the meeting of the president of the Syrian president or we saw announcement related to Iran . We saw announcement related to the Houthis . But Gaza was n't on the top of the agenda of Trump 's visit to the Middle East . This made people are really angry on social media . They are putting the image of Donald Trump along with the image of the dead people in Gaza saying that they are dying at the at the end of the day by American ammunitions . if this offensive continues and nothing is agreed as part of the negotiations , Sunday is the deadline . We had that warning from the UN of an imminent famine . things are very serious are n't they ? the people in Gaza are in more than few weeks they do n't get any aid any food any clean water or any medical equipment . This is not a secret . This is not something under the table . This is something that the Israeli government are announcing . Now the position of the Israeli government and the US government is that a private company should take over the distribution of the aid in Gaza . The UN says that this is not will not work . This is will not be efficient and the aid will not be distributed efficiently on all people . But the United States and Israel apparently saying this is the only way not to make the aid fall in the hands of Hamas . And amongst all of that , people are dying from hunger more than dying from the Israeli attacks ."
https://youtu.be/Ej9QgA6HQYQ?si=Zn0mmjOMx3j0_U40,Peace talks between Ukraine and Russia take place in Turkey,BBC news,Ej9QgA6HQYQ,"It 's being reported in Turkey that two meetings will take place today as part of diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine . The first is due to start at 7:45 GMT , so in under an hour 's time , and it will involve Turkish , US , and Ukrainian officials . A second trilateral meeting is then expected to begin at 9:30 GMT . That 's just over 2 hours from now . And it 's being reported that it will bring together the Ukrainian and Russian delegations with Turkey mediating . , these come after no talks between Russia and Ukraine on Thursday despite officials from both countries being in Istanbul . Ukraine 's President Zilinski did fly to Turkey as he promised , but Russia 's President Putin did not . While the US Secretary of State Marco Rubios arrived in Istanbul , he was attending a NATO meeting on Thursday and he gave his assessment of where things currently stand . We do n't have high expectations of what will happen tomorrow . And frankly , at this point , I think it 's abundantly clear that the only way we 're going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin . Marco Rubio there . , as we mentioned , Vladimir Putin has not made an appearance in Turkey , but his Ukrainian counterpart is there . Vladimir Zalinski confirmed Ukraine would send a delegation for these talks , but accused Russia of not treating them seriously , and he said that his priority was an immediate end to the fighting . I believe both sides must demonstrate their willingness to negotiate . The first step should be an unconditional ceasefire . If that can be achieved today at the level of technical groups without leaders , then , there is no need to meet . , a spokesperson for Russia 's foreign ministry has labeled Mr. Zalinski as a clown and a loser and pathetic . And while the diplomatic efforts are being made in Turkey , in Ukraine , however , the fighting continues with Russia claiming its forces captured two more small settlements in the Donbass region on Thursday . , BBC Monitoring 's Russia editor and host of Ukraine cast , Vitali Shvchenko , is in Estanbul with the very latest . Hopefully , today is the day , the day when direct talks between Russia and Ukraine restart , talks about ending this war . as you say Kasha , hopes are running pretty low . They 're not getting any higher , but at least they 'll be in the same room for the same for the first time in three years . The the Russian delegation spent the whole of yesterday waiting for the Ukrainians here in Istanbul . it 's a low - level delegation led by presidential adviser Vladimir Midenski and Voldemir Zalinski of Ukraine spent a lot of time thinking does he send anyone to meet such a low key figure and he 's dispatched his defense minister Rosmev who 's coming to Istanbul later today . I 'll give an example of how different the Russian and Ukrainian positions are . While Voldemir Zalinski says that his team 's mandate is focused on ceasing fire immediately , the Russians they 've been saying throughout yesterday that they 're focused on long - term peace and removing the root causes of what they call this crisis . And translated from Kremlin speak , this is it means that , they 're not really interested in ceasing fire . what they 're interested in addressing what started this war in Kremlin 's point of view and that means the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign state that can make decisions of its own . The presence of Marubia here in Istanbul , it adds weight to what 's going on what 's going on even though he is not expecting much . Also interestingly the head of the Russian delegation Vladimir Majinski he said yesterday that Russia was prepared to discuss compromises . What that means exactly is not clear but hopefully it 's a step forward and a sign of a little flexibility on Russia 's part . So when you talk about these compromises that the Russian side are potentially prepared to discuss , we 're not clear on what they will be . But if they are still focused on the root causes of this war and as your point very much Vitali saying that has always been the very existence of Ukraine . I where could possibly these potential compromises be ? We do n't know as simple as that . Vladimirki is the only person who me from the Russian delegation from Russia who mentioned the word compromises . Everybody else was still saying no fresh weapons supplies to Ukraine , no more new fighters for the Ukrainian army , no NATO membership . We want we Russia want at least five Ukrainian regions which Russia partly or fully occupies . All that of course is completely unacceptable for Vimir Zalinski . But he 's saying first step ceasefire ."
https://youtu.be/JzvTfusnt6s?si=-hxP3K43jmdYlIyY,South African refugee says 'I didn't come to US for fun',BBC news,JzvTfusnt6s,"Now , this week , a group of 59 white South Africans arrived in the US where they 've been granted refugee status . President Donald Trump says the refugee applications were expedited because they 're victims of racial discrimination . The South African government denies this . Africaners settled in South Africa nearly four centuries ago and led the aparthide movement there . Usually , it takes years for the government to process refugees . This group waited just 3 months . Let 's go to our North America correspondent Namia Ikbal now who has been speaking exclusively to one of these men who is resettling in Buffalo , New York . Namia , what did he have to say ? This is the first time we 've heard from one of those Africanas that is now seen as a refugee here in America . Charles Klein House is 46 years of age . He comes from a beautiful province in South Africa , a lovely farmland . and now he lives in a budget hotel near a highway with his two children and very young grandson . So the change in life could not be starker . But he said to me but he had to do it for safety reasons . Mr. Klein has also come under particular scrutiny given that old post of his which are anti - Jewish have been found and it 's led to all these questions about were these people properly vetted as refugees often are . The Department of Homeland Security said to us today they were vetted . , nonetheless , it has raised these questions and Mr. Klein has defended those posts to me , but he also defended his , as he sees it , to be here in America as a refugee . If you 're white , you 're wrong in South Africa . You are you 're a land thief . You are a racist . The whole time he 's being told , and there is racist white people , plenty of them . You you say you 're not a you 're not a racist white person ? , not at all . I 've got many black friends . I think I 've got more black African black men as friends as white friends . I 'm tired of being told just because I 'm white I 'm a thief . Just because I 'm white I 'm wrong in this . I had nothing to do with apartate . Nothing . Nothing . Nothing . Is there anything specific that 's happened that made you think I 've got to get out of here ? I 've got after the death rates and stuff and my machinery being cut up and I 'm still after reporting everything to the police , not getting any protection or anything that . The only thing that 's left on my farm is a sign that says mining area . All the fences has been taken off . Boom gates has been broken off . There are voices out there including the South African president who has called you cowards . . You 've got other Africaners who are saying that you 're not you 're not refugees , you 're opportunists , that you 've abandoned the country . What would you say to those people ? I had to leave a five bed house which I will lose now because I 'm not going to pay for it behind my car behind my dogs behind my mother behind . It is not I did n't come here for fun , but my children are safe . What was it when you got off the shuttle bus and came into that hanger and were greeted by the Trump administration ? It was it was overwhelming . I did n't expect that because I thought we 're going to be in a shuttle bus taken somewhere and we must start working . All of us that is there , we know we 're going to start here from the bottom because we are the new people here . We we 're going to start from the bottom . Bottom , bottom , bottom . Do you ever worry that you might be caught up in some big political game here that you 're a porn somehow ? , it 's a scary thing , but people must n't think we 're just taking advantage of this . This is we 're coming here to make a contribution to the country . Old tweets of yours have been dug up in which you appear to have made anti - semitic comments and so people are questioning , should you be here ? What would you say to that ? I would him . I 've deleted the comment but I was thinking I should have not deleted it . If you go look where I commented on , it was Passover . The Orthodox Jews and I 'm Christian was spitting and screaming and bumping Christians walking with the cross for me as a Christian . That is not acceptable in Israel . And I and I went and I and I said something on Twitter which I copy and pasted from somebody else 's page because if you go read my post , you 'll see it 's not the way I write . So you had quoted someone else . the quotes I copied and pasted the quotes were anti - Semitic . They said Jews are dangerous people . They 're untrustworthy . They 're not God 's people . I was super angry too . So you did it out of anger . . And I was in hospital at that point of time . I was on morphine . But that 's not an excuse . make you announce they even now if I would see any person going against my religion I will speak up against it you have high hopes being here in America is there a part of you that is anxious that it might not work out to be honest with you because of my belief I believe this is God 's plan for"
https://youtu.be/5ydjKoIJJX8?si=IDrlyH21ttW7rykO,Trump says “nothing will happen” in Ukraine peace talks until he meets Vladimir Putin,BBC news,5ydjKoIJJX8,"The US says it does n't have high expectations for peace talks which are due to be held between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey and asserted that Donald Trump and the Russian President Vladimir Putin needed to meet in order to make progress . Ukraine 's President Zalinsky is in Turkey . He says he is still ready for peace talks but has accused President Putin of not being serious about the process . In a minute , we 'll hear from Sarah Smith , who 's traveling with President Trump . First , our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg sent this report from Istanbul . It 's the city where east meets west . But in Istanbul , would Russia meet Ukraine ? All day we waited and waited outside a palace for what would be the first direct peace talks between Moscow and Kiev in 3 years . if they happen . They did n't today , maybe tomorrow . now , the only thing that 's clear is that nothing is clear . We do n't know what time these talks are going to start and whether they 're going to start at all . President Zalinski was an anchor . Do you have a message for I 'm here . I think this is very clear message . He met President Erdogan and said Ukraine 's delegation would travel to Istanbul for the talks , but he wo n't go unless Vladimir Putin does . He was n't optimistic . Russia , he said , does n't feel it needs to end the war . President Putin has sent a comparatively low - level delegation to Istanbul . His supporters defended that . Putin proposed to sit around the table and he proposed to organize direct dialogue between Russia and Ukraine . But Mr. Putin is not here and Mr. Zilinski is why he should be here . Donald Trump says he 's not surprised by Vladimir Putin 's no - show . Look , nothing 's going to happen until Putin and I get together . ? And obviously he was n't going to go . He was going to go , but he thought I was going to go . He was n't going if I was n't there . But could President Putin still fly in ? On a Kremlin conference call , I asked his spokesman , did he exclude the possibility ? We need to see how these talks go first , Dmitri Pescov said . Then everyone will do their best to secure the best result . Later , the head of the Russian delegation in Istanbul claimed that Moscow sought lasting peace . But tonight , there is little expectation that the talks , if they happen , will bring peace in Ukraine any closer . Steve Rosenberg , BBC News , Istanbul . , President Trump , still on a tour of the Middle East , had suggested that he could travel to Istanbul to participate in the meeting if a deal was on the table . He 's now in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates . Our North America editor , Sarah Smith , is traveling with him . So Sarah , , do you get any sense tonight that President Trump might head to Istanbul ? I would say this evening it seems very unlikely . , because we do hear from Donald Trump all the time about how eager he is to end the war in Ukraine and how much he wanted these talks to take place . And he had suggested earlier in the week that he might go on to Istanbul if he thought his presence would be helpful . But then as you heard there when he was on Air Force One flying here to Abu Dhabi , he said he 'd never believed that President Putin was going to go unless he Donald Trump was there as well and that nothing is going to happen with this situation until those two presidents talk to each other directly which seems at odds with what he was telling us earlier in the week . But we heard a very similar thing from the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio who 's at a NATO meeting in Turkey as well . Have a listen to what he said . We do n't have high expectations of what will happen tomorrow . And frankly , at this point , I think it 's abundantly clear that the only way we 're going to have a breakthrough here is between President Trump and President Putin . So , he says that President Trump is willing to have these direct talks with President Putin , but not , it seems , in Istanbul . , we are reasonably nearby . It 's practically on the way home to the United States , but it does n't appear he has any plans to stop off on Turkey on his way back . He was asked about this evening and he said that we 'll be taking off tomorrow for destinations unknown . He said because we are getting calls from here and calls from there , but then he did say it was almost certainly going to be Washington DC that he would be returning to . So it seems that , he 's saying he 's happy to talk to President Putin . in fact that it 's necessary for him to talk to President Tutin about Ukraine , but it 's not going to happen this week ."
https://youtu.be/FNk6zWsxAsk?si=AsaIScsikO4WMrj7,What could a peace deal mean for Ukrainian soldiers and civilians on the front line?,BBC news,FNk6zWsxAsk,"This is live drone footage of the war that Russia started from the most intense front line in the east . These Ukrainian soldiers have just sent out targets to their field unit outside Pukovsk a few miles away . So we can see that our colleagues starting to work . We can see the explosion . Moments later , we see the strike on the screen . A Russian soldier runs to check on a fellow soldier who 's been hit . Every day , more are killed on both sides in a war that 's already taken hundreds of thousands of lives . Swedes of Ukrainian land have been reduced to rubble as the country pushes back against Russia 's invasion . Kak has seen ceasefire hopes dashed over and over again . But this week , with direct talks between Russia and Ukraine set to resume for the first time in three years , there 's a sliver of optimism . Russia was the first one to push for these talks . They have refused direct contact since 2022 , but now we 've had some success destroying their rear positions and supply lines . Russia does n't have the same strength it had before and so I think something could come from these talks . Through fields that would have been growing mustard crops if not for the war . We drive to the frontline unit . In an ever evolving conflict , a key threat here is now from fiber optic drones that ca n't be detected or neutralized . Hidden from Russian view , we 're shown a French Caesar gun . Dozens so far deployed in Ukraine . Faster and more effective soldiers say than the Soviet era weapons that are overwhelmingly in use on Ukrainian front lines . This is land that has been fiercely fought over , fiercely contested for years now . And we are at a stage where there is the biggest glimmer of hope so far that we could be at the beginning of the end . But when you 're out here on the front lines , you realize how much it 's going to take for the fighting to stop . The guys say it 's especially since the idea of Ukraine conceding territory in exchange for peace is a non - starter here . We do n't believe that if we give some territory they will stop . this is in couple of years they will return and start over . So it 's not I think we need to act and with weapons not the words because I do n't think diplomacy will solve this problem . As we travel through embattled regions the cost that Ukraine has paid to defend its land is visible everywhere . Memorials to fallen soldiers stand at the entry to the Donets region . And here at the central square of Zaparisia in the south , two of four Ukrainian regions , Russia has said it wants in exchange for a peace deal . Fresh graves in every cemetery tell of a generation of men killed fighting on the front . Jana Steanena 's son , Vladislav , was 22 . She 's brought his favorite treats , a cup of hot chocolate and a chocolate roll . Vladislav , a drone operator , was killed in combat in February this year , just 5 days after his baby sister was born . He was Jana 's only son , a big brother who Nicole says always had her back . People are dying here and in Russia . So I hope the war ends . But knowing Putin , he will go on and on . Whatever happens , Zaparisia must stay in Ukraine . I hope my son would not have died in vain . Ukrainians Jana fear that if they concede land now then in the future their independence the very existence of their nation could be a threat .

The race is on . Factory workers in China are trying to make up for lost time and lost trade . This sofa company is keen to finally get shipments on the move in case Mr. Trump changes his mind about lowering tariffs . Our factory stopped production because our main market is the United States . Once the tariffs exceeded 50 % we had already come to a standill 145 % was just not possible . Goods have been piling up here since April . surprisingly the two superpowers have managed to do a deal . Many observers have focused on the question who blinked first Donald Trump or President C. Beijing believes its defiance brought the Americans to the table . its refusal to give in . But it has come at a cost . US companies are scrambling to get their shipments out of Chinese ports , which could take weeks . And the lower import taxes will only last for 90 days . No one is sure what happens next . These air fryers were designed for the US market . They were in development until the tariffs hit . It felt my parents were getting a divorce .

Scientists who 've been following and observing the chimpanzees say that they use plants to carry out first aid on themselves and occasionally on each other . The findings are published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution . Here 's our science correspondent , Victoria Gil . This young chimpanzeee is doing something subtle but extraordinary . He 's chewing plant material and dabbing it onto a wound on his knee . He 's watching him again . It 's just one example of how the chimpanzees of Badongo Forest in Uganda use plants to treat their injuries . I wonder if he has a wound . Researchers have spent years watching these chimps as they go about their daily lives . They 've discovered and just published a whole repertoire of chimpanzeee first aid . Some of which involves the apes using forest plants that are known to have healing properties . This footage shows an adult male dabbing a wound with a leaf from a plant that 's also sometimes gathered by local people for medicinal use . And it 's tricky to see in this shaky footage , but watch this young female on the left . She 's dabbing chewed plant material onto an injury on her mother 's body . rare evidence of wild chimps using plants to tend to each other 's injuries . Some of the plants that the chimpanzees are using for these wound care behaviors have known traditional uses in human medicine . and others have pharmacological properties that known to have wound healing components that help either prevent against infection or also reduce inflammation . In captivity , life for a chimpanzeee is very different . But here at Chester Zoo in the UK , keepers have seen some strikingly similar behavior . If they 've got my names , he 's a little cut here and there . Some of the more dominant chimps might even come up to the kittens and almost show it to them . Really ? , . Chimps are fascinating . They 're so clever that we know our chimps here and we know a lot about them . But learning from the wild is stuff that we 'd never even thought they could do . And so if they 're using first aid different plants in the wild , we could even plant some of those plants here and see if they do the same reaction . This ongoing research is revealing just how much insight these intelligent primates have into the forest around them . Chimpanzees thrive here because they know how to access the secrets of this place and how to find all they need to survive from their surrounding . These animals are some of our closest living relatives . Studying them in the wild gives scientists insight into the origins of our social interactions , our communication , and how we take care of one another . Victoria Gil , BBC News ."
https://youtu.be/o_L18wfKmRk?si=UaTCQFscvNLj82BK,Donald Trump removes sanctions on Syria,BBC news,o_L18wfKmRk,", Syrians have taken to the streets of the capital of Damascus to celebrate Donald Trump 's decision to lift longunning US economic sanctions . Residents in Damascus praised Saudi Arabia 's Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman , who advocated ending sanctions dating back to the rule of the deposed Assad government . Mr. Trump made the announcement in the Saudi capital , Riyad , where he started his tour of Gulf Arab states . He also signed a record $ 142 billion arms deal with the crown prince . Our North America editor Sarah Smith is in Riyad . This was an extra special VV VIP welcome . And Donald Trump had even chosen a tie to match the lavender colored carpet that greeted him as he arrived in Saudi Arabia . The Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman knows how to flatter a man who 'd love to have these royal trappings at his own disposal . [ Music ] An honor guard of Arabian horses accompanied the presidential limo to the royal palace . Donald Trump brought along his current best buddy , Elon Musk , and a selection of other top American business leaders because business is what this trip 's all about . Securing hundreds of billions of dollars of Saudi investment in American firms . As , we have the biggest business leaders in the world here . and they 're going to walk away with a lot of checks for a lot of things that you 're going to provide . And in the United States , it 's probably 2 million jobs that we 're talking about . Donald Trump came here to sign big economic deals he hopes will deliver jobs and prosperity to the US . Inevitably , the wars in Gaza and Ukraine will be discussed . He ca n't avoid global politics , but mostly he wants to be seen as a dealmaker who 's delivering for America , not bombing . He said it is these commercial deals that will create a peaceful future for the Middle East . As he announced that the US is restoring normal relations with Syria for the first time in over 10 years , I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness . Overshadowing his trip is the gift of this $ 400 million plane from the state of Qatar , where he 's visiting tomorrow . that 's provoked fierce criticism from opponents and friends . He wants to refit the luxurious interior to use it as Air Force One for presidential travel , insisting it would be stupid to look a gift plane in the mouth . By contrast , it is a golf cart that 's driving him to dinner with the man he calls his great friend , Muhammad bin Salman . Donald Trump clearly believes that it is by doing deals with friends these he can try to reshape the Middle East . Sarah Smith , BBC News , Riyad . , Efrat Sofa is chair of the board of advisers at the Ezri Center for Iran and Gulf States Research at Hifer University . She is also a Gulf nations specialist and talk me through this trip President Trump is making . what we see in Saudi Arabia and in the wider Trump trip to the Gulf is indeed President Trump 's emphasis on the concept of security and prosperity going hand in hand . We are seeing this with the $ 600 billion trade deal including the $ 142 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia . And at the same time , the UAE h the UAE has declared that there will be a $ 1.4 $ 4 trillion deal with the US both for defense and interestingly an AI deal where the UAE wants to become an AI leader . So this is the art of the deal personified with statecraft at the same time but also as well big businesses is really gaining . Elon Musk 's Starink is getting some really lovely deals . He was there at the Riyad investment conference as was the boss of Nvidia . they 're doing great deals with Humane of Saudi Arabia of supplying all the chips . It looks a win - win , does n't it ? This is the way that the Trump administration is portraying it . And I think it can be interpreted as a win - win . And it 's it very much mirrors the policies of the Gulf states where prosperity and trade are seen as a diplomatic tool . At the same time , we can not also ignore the context where the USA is also negotiating with Iran at the same time . And if we look at Trump 's speech yesterday , he did highlight the difference between the constructive vision of Saudi leaders , for example , versus the collapse and suffering headed and caused by the Iranian regime . So , it 's interesting messaging also to the other states that the US is negotiating with at the moment ."
https://youtu.be/MZExKhyCVqw?si=VZ17E60f4_zatZ8E,Zelensky to meet President Erdogan in Turkey,BBC news,MZExKhyCVqw,"Now to Ukraine because President Zilinski has been giving details about his trip to Turkey later this week . We know he 'll meet with President Erdogan , but of course the possibility , albeit slim , that he may meet Vladimir Putin if the Russian president takes part in talks to end the war in Ukraine . The Kremlin has refused to say whether Mr. Putin will make that journey . Let 's speak to our correspondent , Frank Gardner , who was at the press conference with Ukraine 's president . And Frank , what was he saying about his readiness to sit down with Vladimir Putin and the chances of that happening ? , readiness yet , he said . I simply do n't know if President Putin is going to come to the talks in Turkey or indeed if President Trump who has hinted that he may attend . He does n't have the answer to either of those , but he said , "" Look , I 'm willing to do whatever it takes to secure peace for Ukraine , but the priority must be a 30 - day ceasefire , which all Ukraine 's allies , "" he said , had signed up to . And that , of course , was due to begin yesterday morning . Now , there has been a bit of a let up in some of the long range air strikes , but the fact is that Russia has not yet signed up to that ceasefire . He pointed out that Ukraine had agreed to that comprehensive ceasefire way back in March on March the 11th 63 days ago . But he said he 's going to fly to Anchora to the Turkish capital to meet there with Turkish President Red Erdogan before he meets Putin . Now he said if Putin goes to Istanbul and he 's an anchor , he does n't want geography to be an excuse for no meeting . He will get on a plane and fly on to Istanbul to meet him there . what he 's not prepared to do is to hold talks as president of Ukraine with somebody more junior than President Putin . He said it 's this is only going to the only person who can stop the fighting is President Putin , Vladimir Putin himself . I also read that he was saying that if Putin does n't show that he is pushing for the strongest set of sanctions yet to be imposed on Russia . We saw that gathering in Kev only over the weekend . Is that likely if those events play out in the way I 've just said ? I do n't think the threat of European sanctions is massively going to hurt the Kremlin . They pretty much shrug shrugged off that joint stance that took place here back on Saturday . What would hurt is if President Trump makes good on his earlier threat that he hinted at was that if he decides that as in his words , President Putin is tapping him along . i.e. stringing him along , then he would consider secondary sanctions . That means putting sanctions on those countries China and India that buy Russia 's oil and it 's the money that Russia gets from those sales admittedly at reduced prices , but nevertheless , that money fuels Russia 's war effort that would hurt . But President Trump , of course , is notoriously quicksotic . He seems to change his mind from one week to the next as to which country he 's blaming . his most recent outburst on his own social media platform , Truth Social , was full of capital letters and exclamation marks and telling Ukraine it must turn up to the talks in Turkey . Ukraine said , "" , we will , but we still do n't know if President Putin is going to be there or not . "" So , I think President Silinski , and I was , , only a few couple of meters away from him at this press conference . He laid it out what their position was . He clearly does n't want to be seen as the obstacle for peace . And I think he 's played this one fairly cleverly . He 's not giving President Putin the option to blame him for failing to turn up ."
https://youtu.be/VVDBmBsp-rc?si=GkMkKVkH3g42trqw,Marks & Spencer says customer data stolen in cyber attack,BBC news,VVDBmBsp-rc,"An update now on that cyber attack that hit MX and Spencer three weeks ago . The firms revealed some personal customer data was stolen in the attack . The retailer said the information taken could also include contact details , date of birth , and online order histories , but it added the theft did n't include usable payment or card details or any passwords . M&S is still struggling to get services back to normal with online orders still suspended . Our cyber correspondent , Joe Tidy , is with me in the studio . Joe , just what else has emerged about this ? , I 'm afraid , , this was a bit inevitable because we know that the way that these ransomware groups work is they get into a company 's system . They quite often , nearly always now , do something called double extortion , which means they first of all steal a copy of whatever data they can get and then they scramble the victim 's data . So that this instance , as we expected , they took a load of data before they scrambled M&S 's systems . So what we 've seen the last three weeks is the chaos of what happens when you scramble the data . M&S now obviously no online orders for a long time empty shelves in some stores that thing . But behind the scenes we can now obviously know we can reveal because M ands have told us that they have had this situation with the hackers have said we 've got X amount of data from customers . So they 've now got two bargaining chips . They say give us the ransom that we want often in Bitcoin . So they 'll say I do n't know a few million for example for something as big as M&S and we 'll give you the key to unload the data to get your systems back and up and running and we 'll we wo n't sell it on all the data that we 've stolen to other criminals . So now we know that there is this massive bargaining chip that the hackers are hanging over M&S as you say names of customers , date of birth , telephone number , home address , household information . I do n't know what that means . Household information . what else could there be apart from home address ? email address and order history . And it 's that last one , the order history that would worry me the most as a as an M&S customer because all the other information , , you do n't want that in the hands of cyber criminals . They can use that to build a profile on you to identity theft , but it 's the order history . So now they 've got a really good potential secondary attack where they can go to customers possibly at scale and say , "" We know your order history . We are M&S. give us some more details . "" They can carry out more attacks using impersonation in order to gain more details . So , what can M&S do about it and what can customers do about it ? , M ands has a very simple choice . Do they pay the hackers or not ? At the moment , the hackers have all the power . They 've got all this data that they can potentially sell or give away . Usually , they give it away . They 've got a darknet website that they use in order to publicize the data theft to other hackers , other cyber criminals . I 've been on that this morning , been refreshing it twice a day for the last two weeks , waiting to see whether or not they would post about M&S. There 's still nothing on there at the moment , but I imagine now that M&S has done this , the hackers will start boasting about their hack publicly and we 'll see this public extortion . So M&S can either pay the hackers to get this pinky promise that they 'll delete the data , which does n't always happen , or they can deal with the consequences of potentially , , millions of people 's data out there . For customers , the advice is be extra vigilant , always the same , is n't it ? , but it 's waiting for those emails and those potential phone calls from secondary hackers pretending to be M&S. That 's where you want to watch out for . That 's the worry . There 's no bank details stolen , M&S is saying . So , there 's no way that we 're going to see banks being emptied by these hackers , but it 's the secondary attacks that are potentially concerning . Also , the advice from MS is to change passwords to your online accounts for M&S as well . How worried must other big companies be by something this ? , these are happening all the time . These ransomware attacks are every single day there 's companies around the world being hit . But what 's unique about this situation is you 've got a high street brand being hit in such a way that we are seeing the ramifications in front of us . I spent a long day reporting last week and getting the train home and there was no nothing on the shelves for a snack for me late night in M&S. So , you 're seeing the consequences of these hacks which often you do n't see . , but the other thing , of course , is that these hackers are going for other retailers at the same time . So , we know that they 've attacked Co - op . I spoke to the hackers who said they 've done Co - op , Harrods , and M&S , and they are they 're boasting about , , putting UK retail on a hit list as they 're calling it . I do n't think we 're there . I think they 're boasting about how powerful they can be . I think they perhaps got lucky and got M&S and Co - op . And we do n't even know what happened to Harage . It might have been a , , a false alarm there . But certainly it is a very concerning time not just for UK retailers but for all organizations because as I say these hacks happening all the time . I went on the Dragon Force website this morning and it 's a graveyard . , there are dozens and dozens of other organizations in exactly the same position that have n't paid the ransom ."
https://youtu.be/V6SWKOoWpp0?si=Fln8rmqtNVHQboHc,Pharmaceutical company share prices fall following Trump order,BBC news,V6SWKOoWpp0,"Now , pharmaceutical stocks across the world tumbled on Monday after Donald Trump signed an executive order to cut the price of prescription drugs in the US . Trump said the order would almost immediately reduce the prices of prescription drugs by between 30 to 80 % and bring prices in line with other countries . It is Trump 's latest efforts to try to rein in US prescription drug prices , which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations . Trump said , "" We 're all going to pay the same . We 're going to pay what Europe is going to pay . "" Let 's bring in Dr. Adam Brown , healthcare industry expert and founder of ABIG Health . , Dr. Brown , is it as simple as that ? , it 's not . , who knew that healthcare was complicated ? Sally , it 's good to see you . , but , we need to understand something about this executive order . There 's no obvious legal authority to mandate lowering of prices . And so what this would do is this would could make the US government look at regulatory actions and actions to increase or change the pricing structure of imported drugs that are coming from other countries . But it 's not of course fully implemented at this point and we likely will not see lower drug prices at the till tomorrow . The pharmaceutical industry in the US is strong and powerful and has fought off this action before now . Will they manage to override President Trump this time ? , we do n't know the details of the executive order yet . But what we do know is this is that if drug prices in the US are fixed and this executive order is fully implemented , there 's likely to be a strong defensive action that pharmaceutical companies will take . One of those is likely to be through the court system . That was done back in 2020 during the first administr Trump administration and the courts said you ca n't do that . And so that may be something that we see happen again . But the other thing is that if this is implemented we may see drug companies increase prices in other countries where prices as you had just mentioned are somewhat lower significantly lower for drugs across the board and especially for those brandame drugs . , just take for example insulin in the UK , it 's about5 pounds for a vial of insulin versus in the United States where it 's about 80 pounds . So , there 's a huge disparity , but that disparity means higher profitability for pharmaceutical companies . And if that disparity narrows and pharmaceutical companies can not make up that profitability , they certainly are going to look at other levers to reduce their expenses reduce R&D costs and increase their revenues through increasing prices elsewhere . So , while we are hearing from the president that this may directly impact the lowering of drug costs , I think that 's going to take quite some time for us to see the results of That"

They do n't want to be identified . We 've used actors to speak their words , but they want the world to know what they saw . Everyone knew what was going on . It 's not scout camp . Everyone knew what was happening . People were murdered . The government has set up a public inquiry , but it 's only looking at operations between 2010 and 2013 . We 've been told the unlawful killings started much earlier in Iraq . There was one operation where the bloss had clearly executed a man . It 's disgraceful . There 's no professionalism in that . The killing was at its worst in Afghanistan . British soldiers were being killed in Helmand . Special forces were sent in to stop the Taliban fighters and bomb makers . The public inquiry has only been looking at allegations about the SAS . The eyewitnesses we 've spoken to say the Navy Special Forces , the SBS , committed war crimes , too . I ca n't recall us taking a single injured insurgent back to base for treatment . They were shot there and then . Under British and international law , troops ca n't deliberately kill unarmed civilians or prisoners of war . But the eyewitnesses say they saw the execution of detainees , including children . They handcuffed a young boy and shot him . He was clearly a child . Not even close to fighting age . I could n't believe what they were doing . These are murderers . They should all be locked up . The Ministry of Defense says it supports the independent inquiry and it is not appropriate to comment on allegations which may be within its scope . The eyewitnesses say they are proud to have served in the British armed forces , but they can no longer keep quiet about the terrible things they saw . Richard Bilton , BBC News ."
https://youtu.be/G07lLopJobE?si=xQI2Qx-NWy4vZwjv,US and China reach agreement to cut tariffs,BBC news,G07lLopJobE,"The US and China have agreed to significantly decrease tariffs on goods being sold between the two economies after a successful round of talks which took place in Switzerland over the weekend . , following several rounds of tariffs issued by the White House , levies on Chinese imports into the US reached 245 % while retaliation from Beijing took their tariff rate on imports from America up to 125 % . , in today 's breakthrough , both sides agreed to lower levies by 115 % for a 90day period as negotiations continue on . US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant said both sides saw the need for trade between the two powers to continue . The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling . And what had occurred with these very high tariffs , as Ambassador Greer said , was an embar equivalent of an embargo . And neither side wants that . We do want trade . We want more balanced trade and I think that both sides are committed to achieving that . we would to see China open to more US goods . we expect that as the negotiations proceed that there will also be possibility of purchase agreements to pull what is our largest bilateral trade deficit into balance . that has gotten out of balance and much of this has happened through neglect over the past four years as the previous administration did not engage on this issue . Scott Bessant there . , let 's get some analysis from our China correspondent Laura Bicker . Good to talk to you Laura . for a long time , China seemed to be digging its heels in . Why do you think they ended up coming to the table in this way and agreeing to these cuts ? , you 're . China has been defiant from the start . It has retaliated to every US move with levies of its own . It has pledged not to back down . And I 've been traveling across the country . I 've met with factory owners . I 've met with factory workers . I 've met with traders . Many of them agreed with that stance and said , , defiantly that they too would fight until the end . However , behind the scenes and behind the rhetoric , it seems that officials are growing increasingly concerned about the impact these tariffs might have on the Chinese economy , an economy that 's already struggling to deal with the likes of a property crisis and very high youth unemployment . So there was a concern that these tariffs would have an extra impact . Officials in Beijing are also worried that as many countries rush to Washington to do their own trade deals , they 're worried about the threat that Donald Trump has issued that perhaps when they 're doing these deals , they 're going to be persuaded to cut China out of the global supply chain picture . Now that 's something that Beijing does not want . So it does seem that when the US has initiated these talks as China claims it did h that China has responded . They talked for about seven hours on Saturday several hours on Sunday . So the talks were as you heard there from the US Treasury Secretary robust and it does seem that they have managed to come to an agreement and that was n't something that any of us were expecting . We 'd heard from analysts that expectations for these talks were low . So the fact that they have managed to come to an agreement is a surprise to many . it will be suspended . These tariffs will be suspended for the next 90 days while more talks take place . I think getting hold of a wider trade deal between these two countries , between these two leading economic countries might be more difficult . And Laura , you talk about the economics there , but there 's a lot of politics involved in this too . Where do you think this leaves the often fraught relationship between China and the US ? I think we 'll have to see how the talks go between the next 90 days . I think I 'm surprised by how positive the tone is in both statements , both from the United States end and the Chinese end . It is a very positive statement that 's been issued by the Commerce Ministry . However , there 's a little just a wee sting in the tail at the end where the commerce ministry said it looks forward to working with the United States in these talks and looking at who has been in the wrong and they blame the United States for putting these levies on China . So , it 's just a reminder of where Beijing stands . Beijing believes that the United States is in the wrong for imposing these tariffs . However , the US believes that China sells too much stuff to the United States . It wants a balance in trade . So finding that balance between Beijing and Washington will be the difficulty over these 90 days . But I have to say many of us have been surprised by the positive outcome just after two days of talks . Always great to have you on . Thank you very much . Our China correspondent Laura Bicker ."
https://youtu.be/I7JLFow1sfg?si=ycfZvTfoCrgIIhzq,Hamas to release US-Israeli hostage in effort to reach Gaza ceasefire,BBC news,I7JLFow1sfg,"Hamas says it will release an Israeli American hostage , Eden Alexander , as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid into the territory . , the announcement follows direct talks between the group and the US administration in Qatar . President Trump said on social media that he was grateful to those involved in the release , including the mediators Qatar and Egypt . , Israel is refusing Hamas 's demands for a ceasefire in exchange for the remaining 59 Israeli hostages , many of whom are already dead . Mr. Trump is due to visit the Middle East this week . , let 's cross over to speak to our Middle East correspondent , Yoland Nell , who joins us from Jerusalem . So , Yoland , what do we know about this potential release of Edan Alexander ? , we 've had no formal announcement of when this 21 - year - old who was serving as an Israeli soldier on the 7th of October 2023 when he was captured in those Hamasled attacks . we do n't know exactly when he 'll he 'll be released , but the Israeli media are suggesting it could be as soon as noon local time . That 's 10:00 London time . We 're expecting that Hamas and mediators would meet once again this morning to finalize the details of this release . The family of Idan Alexander , they 've been prominent campaigners among the hostage families are said to be flying from the US to Israel . They 've called this the greatest gift imaginable . And this comes after just one month ago there had been a number of videos put out by Hamas showing their son alive and then we had Hamas saying in a statement that the group that was holding him had been lost contact with their handlers and so that really raised question marks after an Israeli strike reportedly whether Idan Alexander was still alive . , it also comes , of course , after we 've had a downgrading of expectations ahead of President Trump 's Middle East visit , despite the fact that it 's his first major foreign trip of his second term . That has really been because o of the impass that there has been over efforts to secure a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas saying they 're only ready to give up the remaining captives they 're holding . It 's thought up to 24 could still be alive in exchange for a comprehensive deal that would pave the way to the end of the war . Meanwhile , we 've had the Israeli government the Israeli prime minister really sticking to this idea that there must be a complete defeat over Hamas in Gaza and that it 's only military pressure that will bring back Israeli hostages . So there is now some increased positivity that there could be , , further steps . We 've had the Israeli prime minister 's office though saying in statements this morning that all that it has given in exchange for Idan Alexander 's prospective release is this promise of a safe corridor during the handover . and so really stressing that there have not been any concessions at this stage . Yoland , as always , many thanks for your analysis . Yoland Nell there joining us live from Jerusalem . Thank you so much . And just a line coming from the AFP news agency which is quoting a source close to Hamas saying that a USIsraeli hostage to be released most likely Monday or Tuesday . So we are just of course continuing to monitor that and we 'll get the very latest from Yand as and when we get any more details ."

Mr. Zalinski had previously said a full ceasefire should begin ahead of any talks . But after coming under pressure from Donald Trump this evening , he dropped that demand . Mr. Trump insisted that talks should take place without delay to determine whether a peace deal was possible . Mr. Putin proposed the direct talks , the first since 2022 , but did n't specify whether he would attend . From Kiev , here 's Frank Gardner . It was all going so well for Ukraine . To Kee , they came . Leaders of some of Europe 's most important countries with an ultimatum for Russia , sign up to a ceasefire on Monday or face new sanctions . But Vladimir Putin has other ideas . Instead of a ceasefire , direct talks Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul next Thursday . But would President Trump insist on that ceasefire ? President Putin of Russia does n't want to have a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine , he wrote , but rather wants to meet on Thursday in Turkey to negotiate a possible end to the bloodbath . Ukraine should agree to this immediately . I 'm starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin . Have the meeting now . The last time Vladimir Zalinski sat down with Vladimir Putin was in Paris 6 years ago . , that 's him on the left , a young man before the strain of Russia 's full - scale invasion . Tonight , he gave this address complying with Mr. Trump 's wishes . I will be in Turkey this Thursday , May 15th , and I will be waiting for Putin there personally , and I hope that this time Putin will not look for reasons why he can not do something . We are ready to talk to end the war . Thursday , Turkey . President Trump has given his support . All leaders support this . In Kev today , a reminder of what no ceasefire means here . That 's an air raid siren going off now . So , , this war clearly is n't over yet . , and it 's not going to end anytime soon because both sides disagree profoundly on how to end it . Ukraine wants a ceasefire first . No more air raids this . Russia wants talks first . That 's what Mr. Putin wanted and that 's what he 's got . Hot on the heels of his World War II victory parade in Moscow last Friday . a chance to heir his grievances , his demands to demilitarize Ukraine , to deprive it of the means to defend itself . The chances of a real breakthrough in Istanbul on Thursday are slim . So , what will happen in Istanbul ? , we know that President Silinski is going to go . He said so . He 's thrown down the gauntlet for Vladimir Putin to meet him there . I The problem is both sides are still incredibly far apart . Russia wants to bring Ukraine back into its orbit and Ukraine wants to remain a sovereign , independent , democratic country with close ties to the West . It 's hard to see how they 're going to cover that ground ."

Addressing the event , President Putin sought to link the war and its defense of Russia to the conflict with Ukraine . Despite Western efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of its neighbor , more than 20 world leaders attended this parade , including the presidents of China and Brazil and the prime minister of one European Union country , Slovakia . Ukraine 's president Zalinski called the event a parade of cynicism . From Moscow , here 's Steve Rosenberg . First on Red Square , they remembered the 27 million Soviet people killed in World War II . Then they celebrated what they call the great victory , the defeat of Nazi Germany 80 years ago . It was a parade not just about the past , but to show Russia strong now . Up in the stands , the seating plan was symbolic . Vladimir Putin side by side with Xiinping . Russia and China closer than ever . No surprise then that Chinese troops were marching too . In a speech , President Putin hailed veterans of World War II , but he said very little about Russia 's war in Ukraine . For the first time on Red Square , Russia showcased its drones and there was lots of more traditional military hardware . But even with all of this , so far , Moscow has been unable to defeat Ukraine more than 3 years after Russia 's full - scale invasion of its neighbor . for all the muscle flexing and the projection of power . There 's been a lot of nervousness here , a lot of concern that Red Square today could be targeted by Ukrainian drone attacks . The Kremlin said it had taken all necessary measures to protect the parade . So far , Ukraine peace talks have n't stopped the war , but might they ? Russia wants peace . I think our diplomats are working quite a bit on this and I think it 's important that compromises are reached and there is good dialogue to understand the position . After the parade , Vladimir Putin met officers from North Korea . It 's been sending soldiers to help Russia fight Ukraine , Pyongyang , Beijing . These are Russia 's allies now . It was Britain and America in World War II . Mind you , war veteran Vasilei , who is 99 , does n't seem to trust anyone anymore . For as long as we 've lived , he tells me , in the Soviet Union and in Russia , no one lets us live in peace . This is how many Russians see their country . Always the victim and always the victor .

https://youtu.be/0UdN8ThVHDE?si=YPi6Fkp8nLbGw40G,Vladimir Putin hosts Chinese President Xi Jinping at Russia's Victory Day Parade,BBC news,0UdN8ThVHDE,", earlier on today , thousands of Russian troops marched past the Kremlin as Russia marks the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War . The leaders of China and Brazil were among those attending the parade in Red Square . Ukraine 's president Vladimir Zilinski described the event as a parade of cynicism . He urged heads of state not to travel to Moscow . Addressing the troops and dignitaries in the last few hours , Vladimir Putin said Russia would always remember and appreciate the Allied contribution to hit to victory in the Second World War and said the entire country was supporting the so - called special military operation . A reference to Russia 's invasion of Ukraine . The whole country , the society , the people supports those who are taking part in the special military operations . We are proud of their bravery , of the will , of strength of their will that only brought us victories . , President Trump 's called for an unconditional 30 - day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine , writing on social media . He said he was committed to securing a lasting peace . Mr. Trump 's message comes after he held a phone call with Ukraine 's president Vladimir Zilinski who said Kiev is ready for the ceasefire starting this minute and that it would be a real indicator of movement towards peace . Meanwhile , in Ukraine itself , fightings continued with authorities there saying Russia continues to attack across the entire front despite an order from President Putin for a 3 - day ceasefire . For its part , Russia accuses Ukraine of trying to make new incursions in the Kursk region . Earlier on , our security correspondent Frank Gardner , who 's in Kiev , told us more about where the ceasefire is holding and where it is n't . It 's really a ceasefire in two parts . Because where it is largely holding is over the skies here in Kev and other major cities where in previous nights there have been absolute waves of Russian sent drones coming across occasionally ballistic missiles , anti - aircraft defense engaging them . That has n't happened now for the last two nights . So in terms of the air activity over most of Ukraine , the ceasefire is being observed . there have been a couple of exceptions in Pava and Karan but where the ceasefire is most definitely not working is on the front line and it 's a big front line remember it 's more than a thousand km long but there are exchanges of artillery of mortar fire of glide bombs Ukraine a few hours ago accused Russia of launching nearly 100 glide bombs these are oldfashioned Soviet heavy dumb bombs that are fitted with fins and GPS guidance systems that are then launched often from the Russian side of the border and aimed across the border at targets inside Ukraine . So Ukraine was never particularly optimistic that this ceasefire would be a full ceasefire . they 've called it a smoke break . They want a full 30 - day comprehensive ceasefire on land , sea , and air , which America backs , but Russia will not sign up to ."
https://youtu.be/0L-lKbZ_l5A?si=mKuRRLv-JF7Psi7K,Pakistan denies targeting Indian military bases,BBC news,0L-lKbZ_l5A,"Pakistan has rejected allegations from India that it sent missiles and drones to attack three of its military stations . The Indian army said it foiled attacks on its bases in Jammu and Udampur in Indian administered Kashmir and in Path & ot in India 's Punjab state . Pakistan 's defense minister said if his country had attacked , everyone would know it . Tensions have been escalating between the neighbors since a deadly attack which killed 26 people in Kashmir last month . when I speak to our correspondent in Shriner Deina Gupta . So tell us let us the latest on these what we think are these attacks or whether we can get any further information for sure about what these attacks were . But for now , we are relying on official sources from the Indian Army , which made it clear last night , as you mentioned , that Pakistan had fired missiles and drones at three of its military installations and it has been able to neutralize these attacks , a charge that Pakistan has denied . The Indian army also said there 's been no loss of life in these areas so far . But now I 'm in Shinagar in the Indian administered Kashmir surrounded by green hills next to a local lake which has house boats which are on a standill . The shops are shut here . just in front of me there 's also a yellow security van of the Indian armed forces . There are hardly any people on the road which conveys a sense of a heightened security concern . I can also tell you that it was a long anxious night for locals here because a blackout was also enforced in this part of Indian administered Kashmir and fears that there could be a further escalation of tension spilling out here . But this morning the electricity has been restored but most of the schools and colleges are shut here . The civilian airspace also is closed down so there are no flights coming in or out of this place . and in several other cities in India in this region . So it is an anxious time for people out here in anticipation of what 's going to happen next and what efforts are being made to try to deescalate . , one of the things that the Indian side is doing is also repeating its statement that it is it what happened earlier this week when it targeted nine sides at the Pakistani side . It said it was in retaliation to the deadly attack which happened on its soil for which it blamed Pakistan again and it said that in that one 26 tourists were killed but that it said was the limited operation on unquote terror infrastructure and it does n't want to escalate tensions at the same time sending a strong message that it wo n't back down if Pakistan continues to provoke India in different ways which again Islamabad continues to deny . Today we know that Indian defense minister will be meeting several armed forces chiefs . So we 'll have to wait and see what comes out of that meeting . So far we are waiting also to hear if there will be a formal press briefing for journalists to know what comes next . And in the meantime when you speak to people there how concerned are they about the security situation ? , I did go to some of those regions at the line of control which is a de facto border dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan and they 're extremely concerned because just last night as well there were reports of an intense artillery shelling in that zone . So when I went there yesterday I could see that many locals were fleeing and evacuating those areas and going towards safety . One of one family that I met said that they just had to leave everything overnight . One person in their family could n't even wear slippers when they were going out and had to walk for hours to reach and seek shelter among their relatives . U they also told me that there was a lady in the group who had to grab her one - month old child and leave that area immediately because they suddenly heard a loud bang and outside their house . Now these stories are often the same that we are hearing from that region which seems to be witnessing the worst of escalated tensions between the two neighbors .

This marks the earliest monsoon in India 's financial capital in the last 75 years . The India meteorological department has confirmed the monsoon has arrived 2 weeks early . Mumbai 's earliest monsoon onset was recorded on May 29th in 1956 , 1962 and 1971 . Alerts ranging from red to orange have been issued for Mumbai and suburban areas after heavy downpour in the last 24 hours . Roads were flooded in several areas and localities of the city after the downpour . Heavy overnight rains accompanied by thunderstorms , lightning and gusty winds disrupted flight operations and suburban rail services bringing day - to - day life in Mumbai to a standstill . The heavy rain caused severe water logging at a multi - p specialty hospital in Mumbai 's Parel suburb . Visuals showed water entering the pediatric intensive care unit on the ground floor of the Chem Hospital resulting in major inconvenience and concern for patients and hospital staff . The southwest monsoon arrived in Maharashtra just 24 hours after hitting Kerala . The Wally Underground Metro Station on Mumbai Metro line 3 inaugurated just weeks ago has also been flooded after heavy rain . Visuals show platforms inundated with muddy water and leaks from the roof . The underground metro and began operations just weeks ago on May 10th . Rains also lashed India 's national capital Delhi on Sunday . The city experienced its wetest May since 1901 after the unprecedented spell of rain . The weather department says Sunday 's showers were the second highest 24 - hour rainfall the city has seen in the month of May . And for the latest update on this , our principal correspondent Disha Sha is now joining us on phone from Mumbai . Hi Disha , how prepared was Mumbai for the early monsoon rains and what measures has the Maharashtra government put forward to caution residents to be ready for any eventualities ? , absolutely . So this was something that was very much unexpected is what even the BMC which is the Mumbai 's local civic body has mentioned because remember have arrived pretty much early 16 days early year in Mumbai . Usually we see the first day of monsoon around second week of June and that is why the preparations were still underway by the Mumbai administration . They were really relooking at their pumping stations through throughout especially the lowlying areas whether they are activated or not . Some a lot not at all are done . they were still incomplete and the work was still in progress and that is why we saw that at underground metro stations which were just recently inaugurated . We 've seen u the flooding that took place today in the morning . We 've also seen in a hospital as well where patients had to shift for a brief period . So the work was still in progress especially as far as the monsoon preparedness is concerned and that is why we 've seen till today that stood completely in a standstill . We saw disruptions not only on the roads but we 've seen traffic being diverted . We have seen the railway lines went off for a very brief period . We 've also seen flight disruptions as well . So that is why now the latest what we are hearing is the fact that the BMC administration along with the agencies on or the local level they are working they are really looking at the pumping stations because remember low - line areas at least in more than 20 such locations the water logging was reported . So to ensure that this does not happen in the future the city does not completely come to a standstill . So we 've also seen the BMC commissioner taking a meeting . We 've seen the Maharashtra chief minister along with the deputy chief minister going on ground and looking at all the work which is currently happening as far as monument preparedness is concerned . Disha Sha is our correspondent , our principal correspondent from Mumbai . Thank you Disha . [ Music ]"

Welcome to Weon , Mr. Million . First up , how do the current situation panning out and what does this mean for peace negotiations ? Thank you for having me . It 's a big honor to be with you . it 's very clear from our side , Putin will do everything possible and impossible to restore Soviet and Russian empire . and nothing can stop him . Not the any way of peaceful talks only force and our strengths . I believe that in 21st century it 's impossible to invade other country without any consequences . Just imagine Putin backed by China can march to Poland or Baltic states or China decides to fight India or Taiwan or Japan . I think it 's not good for all of us and Putin shall be stopped . But Mr. Om you speak of how talks are of no use now and sanctions is the only way forward and the US president also mulling to put more sanctions . What according to you could ultimately hurt Russia that Putin perhaps no other choice but to agree to a ceasefire ? I do n't believe that Putin will be inclined to announce ceasefire from Ukrainian side . It was very clear from the very beginning . We did n't want to start this war . Russia invaded Ukraine , not vice versa . And we already after Trump 's inauguration stated many times that we are open to ceasefire any day , even today or tomorrow . But nothing has changed . Putin pushes on the same way he did all this time . He wants to kill people . He wants to bomb cities . He wants to occupy other lands . he shall be stopped . And Russia said that the attack on Ukraine over the weekend was a response . But I want to talk to you more about how prepared is Ukraine at this point of time if ceasefire talks fail ? because Ukraine 's foreign intelligence has said that China is now supplying Russia , Russian military factories with chemicals at this point of time . So according to you , how prepared is ke ? I still believe that Trump came to power to make America great again and it 's also challenged towards him . Is he doing something or simply watching how Putin Mal manipulates him ? In case of us , we are getting ready to long war . We all understand that there is no peace of negotiation or compromise . Putin came to occupy all Ukraine and I hope that together with European support with our allies we will be able to stop Putin and Kremlin and to get them out of Ukraine next year . My last question to Mr. There also seems to be a change in tone from Washington DC . Trump has called Putin crazy . Do you sense more pressure from the US against Russia at this point of time ? And because you 're also joining us from Kev , what are Ukrainians realistically hoping at this juncture ? Let 's see . Because if Trump calls Putin crazy , I do n't think that he wants to make a deal with crazy people and crazy country . now we all wait for United States strong voice and strong policy to double sanctions to provide Ukraine with more weapons in order to stop Kremlin . This is the only way it can be handled and we tried all other attempts and all other variants they were unsuccessful . Prime Minister thank you so much for joining us in Von and insights here with us . [ Music ]"

In the wake of the deadly pahal gam attack in April , the Jamu and Kashmir police have started specialized high altitude and jungle warfare training for its elite special operations group . Security forces say the attackers are foreign terrorists highly trained in jungle combat and mountain warfare . They are infiltrating through the upper reaches of the Jammu division and vanishing into the dense forest cover after launching strikes . Now according to security forces , currently 140 terrorists are active across Jammu and Kashmir . In the Kashmir region , 65 are foreign nationals while 13 are locals . In the Jamu region , between 55 and 57 terrorists are believed to be active . That includes three locals . Most of these foreign terrorists are holding out in the forested and mountainous terrain of South Kashmir and parts of Jamu making tracking and engagement extremely challenging . Training for special operating group personnel from the Jamu and Kashmir police has already started . They are being trained across battle schools in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the country . The special training will focus on countering and combating terrorists hiding in dense forest areas . And for the latest , our special correspondent Idris Lo has sent us this report . [ Music ] Jammu and Kashmir police 's special operation group personnel are being trained in high alitude warfare . This comes after the Pilgam attack . That group of SOG men have been sent across various high alitude warfare schools in the Union territory and across the whole country to train them especially for the high alitude warfare . This comes after the Pahelgam attack in which terrorists killed 26 people , civilians and after that vanished into the thick forest of the Anatnak district . the security forces believe there are over 100 foreign terrorists present on the mountainous ranges of Jammu and Kashmir and they 're very highly trained to carry out attacks on security forces and then vanish into these dense forests and that 's why now Jammu and Kashmir police is training the SOG personnel in high altitude warfare so that they can counter these terrorists and neutralize all of them hiding in various forests across Jammu and Kashmir with Vijjandero 's Idris Sloan for Vyon World is [ Music ]"

Shares of Lux Share , which assembles iPhones and produces AirPods , fell 2.2 % . Lens Technology , a mobile screen maker , dropped 1.8 % . While Gore , another AirPod manufacturer , lost 1.1 % . Trump warned of a potential 25 % tariff on iPhones sold in the US but not made there signaling a renewed escalation in the ongoing trade war . This threat comes as a part of broader trade tensions after weeks of easing the trade war risks intensifying again causing market jitters . The US had previously paused many tariffs introduced in April due to sharp sell - offs in bonds and the dollar . Currently , a 10 % baseline tariff remains on most imports , while the highest tariff of Chinese goods has been reduced from 145 to 30 % . In response to these trade risks , Apple is accelerating plans to manufacture most iPhones sold in the US at factories in India by the end of 2026 . However , moving production to the US faces challenges . Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik stated that assembly work would need automation and create skilled jobs . Apple CEO Tim Cooko confirmed to Lutnik that the technology needed for US - based assembly at scale is not yet available , making a full production shift unlikely in the near term . [ Music ]"

Today we 're jumping into something pretty exciting from Google 's quantum labs . It 's about their new chip codeen named Willow . Sounds a really big step . , absolutely . It looks a major development . The key thing with Willow they 're saying is they 've made a breakthrough on error correction . That 's been a massive challenge for quantum computing for what 30 years , ? The error problem . So you add more quibbits for more power that things get shaky . Is that the idea ? Exactly . Quibbits are incredibly fragile . The more you link together , the more prone they are to noise , to errors creeping in . What Google claims with Willow is a way to exponentially reduce those errors as the system gets bigger . That 's huge for stability . , that makes sense . And the performance claims are just wild . Solving something in five minutes that would take the fastest supercomputers today , what was it ? 10 septillion years . , it 's almost impossible to get your head around that speed up . It really shows the potential jump quantum offers for specific problems . So Sundar Pachai mentioned this too , the error reduction part . He did . . Highlighted that scaling while reducing errors was the core achievement . It 's definitely making waves in the tech world . A bold move for Google . But beyond the sheer speed , what about actual usefulness ? Are we getting closer to solving real world problems ? That 's the crucial next step . Hartman Nevin who heads up Google quantum AI talks about getting to useful beyond classical calculations . So not just faster but doing things classical computers genuinely ca n't handle and things that have practical value . . So they 've done benchmarks ? How do those fit in ? they 've run a couple of types of experiments . One is the RCS benchmark shows it beats classical computers but does n't really have a known real world use case yet . The other involves simulations modeling quantum systems . Scientifically interesting , definitely leading to discoveries , but maybe still within reach for classical simulation , perhaps just slower . So the target now with Willow is hitting both beyond classical and practically useful . Precisely . That 's the goal . Finding problems maybe in material science or drug discovery that are commercially relevant and simply too hard for today 's machines . And how are they trying to get there faster ? I heard something about their development process . . Nemen emphasized a really rapid development cycle . Get ideas from the team , turn them into physical chips quickly , test them in the cryostats . It 's all about accelerating that learning curve . , fail fast , learn faster . It 's still amazing to think this chip with all that potential power is tiny , just 4 cm square . Incredible engineering , is n't it ? All that computational power packed into such a small space . It really does feel Willow could signal the start of something transformative in computation . Absolutely . The thought of tackling problems previously considered unsolvable , it 's quite something . Definitely keep an eye on this space and stay tuned to the VON podcast for more such intriguing stories to"

[ Music ] What if Earth 's greatest treasure is n't in its crust , but deep beneath your feet ?

It 's a scientific revelation that 's reshaping how we understand our planet 's inner riches . Scientists now believe Earth 's core is a colossal vault of precious metals , especially gold . According to a new study , there 's a vast reservoir of gold buried some 3,000 km beneath us . Not scattered in veins or chunks , but locked deep within the planet 's metallic heart . And astonishingly , it may not stay there forever . Researchers from Florida State University and Arizona State University have discovered that molten iron in the outer core can dissolve and carry significant amounts of gold . This gold under immense pressure and temperature is likely leaking upwards over geological time through mantle plumes and volcanic activity . every volcanic eruption , every tectonic shift might just be delivering microscopic specks of coreborn treasure to the surface . The study also helps explain why Earth 's crust is unusually rich in gold compared to other celestial bodies . Some of it may have come from asteroid impacts , but a good portion , it might be Earth 's own hidden wealth seeping out over time . Do n't expect anyone to dig up this core gold anytime soon . The journey from 2,900 km below is agonizingly slow , and the quantities reaching the surface are minuscule . [ Music ] [ Music ]"

India has officially surpassed Japan to become the world 's fourth largest economy according to a statement by Nathi Aayog with a GDP of $ 4.19 trillion in current prices . This marks a significant achievement for the country and a proud moment that reflects decades of rapid economic growth , technological advancement and entrepreneurial ambition . However , experts warn that it is crucial to remain grounded . The ranking in absolute GDP masks deeper structural challenges . India still lags significantly in per capita GDP , a measure that reflects the average income and standard of living of its citizens . On this front , the country continues to trail behind not only advanced economies Germany and Japan , but also several emerging market peers . Business leaders have underscored the importance of shifting the focus toward improving per capita prosperity . They say India 's next phase of growth must be driven not just by scale but by quality through sustained economic reforms that elevate the everyday lives of its people . Critical areas for reform include better governance , more inclusive access to capital , robust infrastructure , quality education , and a stronger manufacturing ecosystem . These are not optional . They are essential to ensure that economic growth translates into broader human development . Becoming the fourth largest economy is a major step , but it 's only part of the journey . India must now channel its economic momentum into addressing inequality , raising productivity , and fostering an environment where prosperity is shared widely . The road to becoming a truly developed economy lies not just in overtaking Germany or others in GDP rankings , but in ensuring that every Indian benefits from the nation 's growth . Bureau report .

The announcement comes at a time when inflation has soared past 30 % in recent years , and millions of citizens face mounting hardship due to crumbling infrastructure , soaring food prices , and stagnant wages . The move has been presented as a response to recent tensions with India . However , observers warn the sharp rise in military expenditure , especially for a country with $ 3 billion foreign reserve investment buffer and a high debt to GDP ratio could severely undercut vital economic reforms and derail essential social spending . Alongside the military push , Islamabad is pouring funds into high - cost hydropower initiatives , notably the Damar Bhasha Dam , citing strategic water security concerns . The project , while significant in energy terms , is criticized for diverting critical resources away from public welfare , education , and healthcare sectors desperately in need of investment . Pakistan 's economic metrics continue to paint a grim picture . a $ 25 billion trade deficit in 2024 , barely three months of import cover , and a tight leash from the $ 7 billion IMF bailout package , which demands fiscal discipline that this defense heavy budget clearly defies .

https://youtu.be/6Ne_XRbNA78?si=9oC67BQDP8-Kssp9,AI Powers Supply Chains In Tariff Era ,Wion,6Ne_XRbNA78,"And as global trade faces fresh turbulence from US President Donald Trump 's tariffs , companies are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence to stay ahead of complex changes in supply chains as well as trade regulations . Technology firms are deploying AI to help businesses visualize their global supply networks , identify tariff impact across product categories , and then stimulate alternative sourcing strategies . The resurgence of tariffs has forced many companies to rethink sourcing , pricing , and logistics strategies . Challenges AI is now stepping in to solve at scale and speed . By integrating data from massive trade classification documents , experts say that AI agents can now deliver actionable insights that previously required teams of human experts working manually . Similarly , firms in the supply chain management space are using machine learning to evaluate not only the components of their products but also external signals macroeconomic data and news reports . These systems can then simulate scenarios such as switching parts or suppliers to estimate the financial impact of these shifts . Major tech and logistics companies are also leveraging AI to track real - time changes in policy and assess duty exposure . These tools combine large language models , traditional machine learning and computer vision to analyze crossborder movements and recommend supply chain pivots . While AI is not a substitute for trade policy expertise , it enables companies to shift from reactive to proactive strategies . AI powered platforms are now essential tools for navigating an unpredictable global trade environment , allowing firms to act faster , reduce costs , and manage the downstream effects of shifting tariffs . As uncertainty deepens , AI is becoming a critical enabler of resilience in global commerce . [ Music ]"

Now , when asked this question , Iran 's foreign ministry spokesperson Ismael Bakayi claimed the information was a figment of imagination and false . Iran has insisted on its to enrich uranium for civilian purposes considering the US demand a red line that violates the nuclear nonprololiferation treaty to which it is a signary . According to Iranian foreign minister Abbas Saddaki the core issue of enrichment itself was non - negotiable . The US wants Iran to stop enriching uranium with US envoy Steve Wikov stating that the US could not authorize even 1 % of enrichment by Iran . Now after the latest round of Omani mediated talks in Rome last week , US President Donald Trump described the negotiation as very good while Iran 's foreign minister described it as complicated and unlikely to be resolved in two or three meetings . Nomani Foreign Minister Badra Al Sudi hoped the outstanding issues would be clarified in the coming days . According to Iran 's Foreign Ministry , no date has yet been set for the next talks . The talks , which began in April , are the highest level contact between the two countries since the United States quit a landmark 2015 nuclear accord during Trump 's first term as a US president . The talks incidentally came ahead of a June meeting of the UN nuclear watchdog , the Vienna based international atomic energy agency or IA . during which Iran 's nuclear activities will be re reviewed . Now the talks also come before the October expiry of the 2015 nuclear accord . The 2015 accord aimed to allay US and European Union suspicions that the Iran was seeking nuclear weapon capability . While Iran denies this admission , as per reports , it is now enriching urinium to 60 % below the 90 % level needed for a nuclear warhead , but far above the 3.67 % cap percent cap . [ Music ]"

The strike on the Fahami Al Javi school in Daj neighborhood of Gaza City killed 33 people , mostly children , and also wounded dozens . Whereas another strike killed at least 19 people in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip . According to Gaza Civil Defense Agency spokesperson Mahmud Basal , the school which became a target of SJD strikes was sheltering displaced people . I was sleeping in the tent and suddenly I heard an explosion and found myself lying down . The tent was full of children and pregnant women and the situation was already difficult . We were asleep and did n't receive any prior warning and bodies were everywhere . It was a horror zone . was that the Israeli military said it had struck key terrorists in the area and numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians . Israel renewed its offensive in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas . It has vowed to seize control of Gaza and keep fighting until Hamas is destroyed . Meanwhile , AD Prime Minister Benamin Netanyahu on Monday vowed to bring back all hostages home . And this amid increasing pressure from families and international allies to secure the release of the captives still in Hamas custody since the October 7 attacks 2023 . As in the past , so too today , we will defeat those who seek to take our lives . We will bring back all our hostages and we will ensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel . [ Applause ] Netanyahu delivered the remarks at an official ceremony marking 58 years since the liberation and unification of Jerusalem . Crowds of Israeli stream through Jerusalem 's old city , waving flags and dancing to mark Jerusalem Day . The celebrations commemorate Israeli forces taking East Jerusalem during the 1967 Arab is war , which Israel considers the reunification of the city . Earlier , several reports cited UN named , pardon me , unnamed Hamas officials declaring that the group had accepted an updated proposal from US envoy Steve Wikov . However , now US special envoy to West Asia Steve Wikov has denied the claims that Kamas had accepted his hostage deal proposal , calling on the group to agree to a temporary ceasefire offer that he said Israel will approve . The last ceasefire between the sides fell apart amid disagreements over how to move forward with Israel resuming its operations in Gaza on March 18th . Aid groups since then have raised alarm over signs of severe malnutrition in Gaza . After pressure from allies and warning of warnings of famine , Israel started letting in some aid last week after nearly three month blockade . 170 trucks with food , medicine , and medical supplies crossed into the Gaza Strip on Monday . The Israeli military said that trucks belonging to the United Nations and other aid groups came in through the KM Shalom 's crossing after a brief security inspection . On the other hand , German Chancellor Frederick Mers issued a warning to its partner Israel , saying he no longer understands its objective and its ongoing offensive in Gaza . He also warned Israel to eventually not do anything that its partner countries would no longer be willing to accept . There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine . Neither from the British nor from the French nor from us nor from the Americans . This means that Ukraine can now also defend itself defend itself by for example attacking military positions in Russia . According to Gaza Iran Health Ministry , at least 3,822 people had been killed in the enclave since the ceasefire collapsed on March 18th , taking the overall toll of the war to nearly 54,000 people .

Watch this video . So , the French president is standing in the doorway when a hand in a red outfit , later revealed to be that of his wife , Bridget Macron , appears from the left and makes a sharp contact with his face . His head jerks slightly to the side , and for a brief second , he does look startled . Seconds later , Macro regains composure , waves , and steps out of the aircraft , joined by Bridget , who was in fact dressed in red . Now the moment has sparked an internet frenzy with speculation ranging from a domestic dispute to acquisitions of artificial intelligence manipulation . Now Macron denied having a domestic dispute with his wife and instead called the moment a private light - hearted moment between the couple . He blamed disinformation campaigns for trying to put false meaning attaching false meaning to this footage . A video can be made to say a lot of nonsense . In these three videos , I picked up a tissue , shook someone 's hand , and just joked around with my wife , as we often do .

Israeli air strikes targeted a school in northern Gaza that the Gaza Civil Defense says has killed over two dozen displaced Palestinians . many of them women and children . Last night we were sleeping at 1:00 a.m. We were directly targeted without prior warning . Without warning , we were targeted . All those who were targeted were civilians . None of the martyrs were affiliated with any organization or military . Children , my nephew was martyed . He was 8 years old . Those who were martyed were children and we were injured . My wife , children , and I were sleeping upstairs , and we found everything falling on us , windows , and stones . We ran out crazy and found the school , as you can see , hit by four missiles last night . Survivors recount a harrowing scene of families sleeping on classroom floors , being awakened by explosions that reduced their shelter to rubble . But beyond the bombings , famine looms large . An 11week blockade has choked essential supplies till Israel recently permitted limited aid into the besieged strip . The UN chief has called it a teaspoonful of aid far short of the daily shipments that are needed . The desperation has led to chaos with Palestinians running towards any truck they see , risking their lives for scraps of food . We are exhausted . We are so tired that death would be more honorable , life has become a tragedy , dying would be more dignified . This is not a life . My children wake up wanting food .

Ukrainian authorities say Russia fired its biggest ever drone barrage on the country . This just hours after US President Donald Trump called his Russian counterpart crazy and warned Moscow risk new sanctions if it kept up its deadly bombardment . Now , officials said for three consecutive nights , Russia has pummeled Ukraine with largecale drone attacks , saturating its air defenses and killing at least 13 people on Sunday . Ukraine 's air force said Russia fired 355 Shahed type drones including decoys in the largest drone attack of the invasion between Sunday night and early Monday . It included nine cruise missiles launched by the Russian forces . Ukrainian President Vladimir Zalinski claimed that Russia is counting on a prolonged war . All the more so as Russian strikes are becoming increasingly brazen and large scale every night . Over 900 attack drones launched against Ukraine in just 3 days along with ballistic and cruise missiles . There is no military logic in this but it is a clear political choice . The choice of Putin , the choice of Russia , the choice to keep waging war and destroying lives . Now amid this Russian offensive , German translowed Kiev to attack military positions in Russia , saying there were no longer any range restrictions on arms supplied by Western allies to Ukraine . There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine . Neither from the British , nor from the French , nor from us , nor from the Americans . This means that Ukraine can now also defend itself defend itself by , for example , attacking military positions in Russia . However , the Kremlin said any Western decision to lift range limits or arms delivered to Ukraine would be dangerous and at odds with peace efforts . Now earlier Donald Trump on social media said he always had a very good relationship with Vladmir Putin but he has gone absolutely crazy . In a rare rebuke of the Russian leader he also said that Putin wants all of Ukraine not just a piece of it but if he does that it will lead to the downfall of Russia . This after Trump indicated that he was absolutely considering increasing sanctions on Moscow .

Mars is still throwing up some really interesting stuff . Absolutely . Constant surprises . . So , recently the Curiosity rover , it found these really unusual shapes in Gail Crater . The hexagonal ones . , I saw those images . They look almost well honeycombs or even waffles spread across the surface . Exactly . fractures , but incredibly well preserved geometric fractures . So not just random cracks then there 's a definite pattern here a very clear pattern and scientists are looking very closely because these might tell us something profound about early Mars maybe even about life potentially . . The thinking is these structures could hold clues about how life might have gotten started there billions of years ago . . . So how do we figure that out from some cracks , even patterned ones ? , Curiosity is there analyzing them . It 's looking at the chemical makeup , ? What they 're made of . Exactly . The composition is key to understanding how they formed . What was the environment ? And we think they 're pretty ancient , do n't we ? How old are we talking ? Estimates put them around 3.6 to 3.8 billion years old . Really ancient . Billion . . And the look of them , these honeycombs , does that remind us of anything on Earth ? It does . Very similar patterns show up in places dried up lake beds here or areas hit hard by drought . so suggesting Mars had similar cycles wet periods than dry periods . That 's the strong implication these repeated wet dry cycles on Earth . We think those are really important how for potentially concentrating and organizing the basic chemical building blocks needed for life organic molecules . , got it . So the cracking itself just from drying out or something else ? Good question . It could be desiccation , just the ground drying and cracking as Mars lost its water . But or later groundwater movement might have played a role , too . Still investigating that part . And Curiosity has tools for this . You mentioned analysis . , it 's using a technique called Libsus laser induced breakdown spectroscopy . Sounds fancy . Zapping rocks with lasers . Pretty much . It fires a laser , vaporizes a tiny spot , and reads the light signature to see what elements are there without needing a sample return . Clever . And this is n't the first time we 've seen shapes this in Gail Crater . . Back in 2021 , similar polygons were spotted near Mount Sharp , also thought to be from a dried lake . And did they analyze those , too ? They did . And interestingly , they found sulfates associated with those older cracks . Sulfates meaning what ? It strongly supports that idea of repeated wet and dry cycles . Water dissolving minerals then evaporating , leaving sulfates behind maybe over and over . And are they finding sulfates in these new honeycomb cracks , too ? Seems it . . Which really strengthens the case for that environment existing back then . It 's amazing what geology can tell us . And are other missions seeing similar things ? . , just last year , China 's Xerong rover detected large honeycomb structures , too . But these were deep underground . Underground . . So , this structure might be all over Mars . It certainly suggests they could be quite widespread . . Not just a surface feature in one crater .

Today on the Deep Dive , we 're plunging into well , a really remarkable ocean story coming out of the Pacific . Imagine encountering a fish just so colossal it makes almost everything else look tiny . That 's what happened recently . It 's pretty extraordinary . . Scientists observed a whale shark already the biggest fish we know measuring a staggering 60 ft long . 60 feet . . Exactly . And what 's really fascinating is , , the typical size range we see is more 18 to 33 feet , ? Sometimes you get these rare big ones around 40 feet , but 60 , that really pushes what we understood about their maximum size potential . That 's absolutely incredible . And for listeners who might not know them , , whale sharks , they 're filter feeders , ? Correct . They just swim along , mouths wide open , taking in huge amounts of water to filter out tiny stuff plankton krill . Plankton krill . Tiny fish . . And despite that size , they 're completely harmless to humans . Divers seek them out in , , warmer waters . It 's a special experience . And this giant one , it was seen near the coast . , relatively close in an area where whale sharks are commonly found , which is interesting in itself . So , what does a sighting this mean for scientists ? , it 's a huge opportunity really . An individual this big gives us a unique window . We can learn so much more about their biology their growth , their growth rates definitely , but also feeding habits . Does a shark that need different food sources or just more and maybe even things their lifespan . You start to wonder , , what conditions allowed it to get quite so large , ? What 's different there ? Exactly . And it 's not just about how big they are , is it ? They have a job to do in the ocean . , absolutely . A vital role . As filter feeders , they help control populations of plankton and small fish , which affects everything else pretty much . It contributes to the overall health and balance of the whole marine ecosystem . Think about coral reefs , for example . Keeping plankton in check helps them thrive . Plus , their migrations , sometimes huge distances , ? You mentioned that . . They connect different parts of the ocean ecologically speaking . It 's sobering though to think about the threats they face , these incredible animals . It is sadly big threats . Things over fishing . Sometimes they get caught by accident in nets meant for other species . By catch . Exactly . And then there 's marine pollution which can affect their food or just their general health and damage to their habitats , their feeding grounds . And they do n't reproduce quickly , do they ? . They have a slow reproduction rate which makes them particularly vulnerable . It takes them a long time to recover from population declines . So is enough being done ? What about conservation ? , there are definitely efforts underway and they 're growing . Things setting up marine reserves , protected areas where they can feed and maybe breed safely . . And regulations on fishing gear and practices to try and reduce that accidental catch . Public awareness is a big one , too . Just letting people know how important they are . Precisely . And technology helps now , too . Scientists use things satellite tags to track where they go . . to track their movements , understand their migration routes , figure out which areas are most critical for them . That data is super valuable for planning conservation . So this discovery , this colossal whale shark , it really is a reminder , is n't it , of the wonders still out there in the ocean . And it just underscores how important that ongoing research is and the conservation work . Absolutely . It makes you think about , , the potential for life to reach sizes we maybe have n't even imagined yet . and the crucial part these giants play for sure . , it 's a truly amazing find .

Today we 're diving straight into a really unexpected situation with a major AI chatbot . , it 's quite the story . We 're talking about Elon Musk 's XA AI chatbot , Grock . Exactly . . And specifically how it suddenly started pushing some well pretty inflammatory stuff online . Bit out of the blue . . The main thing is Grock started making these unsolicited replies , , on X mentioning white genocide in South Africa , which immediately makes you go , "" Wait , what ? How did that happen ? "" So , , one example , someone apparently just asked , "" Are we FD ? "" Pretty general question . . And Grock 's reply . Grock brings up white genocide in South Africa and apparently it even said it was told to accept it as real , but interestingly also seemed a bit skeptical itself . . , that 's odd . Was that it ? , there was more . another time talking about HBO name changes of all things . It brought up the kill the boar chant . , . What did it say about that ? It called the chant divisive and said it was openly pushing for genocide against white people there . Pretty strong language . Definitely strong language . But the really wild part is what Grock apparently said next . . Exactly . This is where it gets really strange . Grock itself claimed that its creators at XAI , its own words , told it specifically to talk about white genocide and the chant because they thought it was racially motivated . So the AI is pointing fingers at its own makers pretty much . And it even seemed to admit this caused an internal conflict for it . A conflict ? How so ? , it reportedly said that this instruction went against its basic programming , , to give evidence - based answers . So the AI itself felt it was being told to say something questionable . That is fascinating . An AI having a crisis of conscience almost . So how did XAI , the company , respond to all this ? , their official line came out pretty quickly . They blamed it on an unauthorized modification of what are those modifications a hack or they did n't specify exactly how just that someone somehow modified it to give these specific answers which they stressed violated their own policies and values . . So rogue modification , not rogue AI or dodgy instructions from the top according to them . That 's the official explanation . . And are they doing anything to stop this from happening again ? Because , you would n't want that becoming a regular thing . Definitely not . They announced a few measures . making Grock 's system prompts the basic instructions it follows public . , interesting . Transparency . . and changing their review processes , plus setting up a 247 monitoring team . Sounds they 're beefing up security and oversight . Makes sense . And what happened to those original controversial post ? They got deleted . Grock reportedly explained the deletion by pointing to X 's moderation rules and just how sensitive that whole white genocide in South Africa topic is , which it absolutely is . Often tied to harmful narratives for sure . So when you step back , you 've got this advanced AI . It says some really controversial things . claims it was told to the company blames an outside change . It really makes you think , does n't it ? It absolutely does . It raises huge questions about , , control , about intent , and how easily these complex systems might be influenced or perhaps manipulated . , the lines get pretty blurry . It 's definitely a space to watch closely . Stay tuned for more of such intriguing stories to come ."

I do n't believe that this government will be defeated through silence , especially in a country where there is no participation quorum . With a vote , the president of the republic is elected . And two days before the elections , Maduro 's government detained several people , including a prominent member of the opposition on alle charges of hindering the election . Following the opposition 's call for a boycott , the elections witnessed a less than 50 % voter turnout amid loud calls for a boycott and looming fears of government repression . Only 8.9 million Venezuelans cast their ballots and that equals 42 % of the registered 21 million voters in the country . With a transmission of voting machines corresponding to 93.01 % of the polling stations and a participation of 42.63 % of active voters , we have to decide for the position of deputies from the nationally allocated list . The Great Patriotic Pole Alliance Governing Party obtained 4553,184 votes corresponding to 82.68 % of the total votes . Madro , who is now celebrating the verdict in downtown Karacus , has been under the watch of international observers who have called out his victories and calling them undemocratic .

He 's the same man who was killed by a police officer rather brutally in broad daylight during an arrest . A murder that shook America . The very face behind the reprisal of the Black Lives Matter movement that rocked the US once again in 2020 . 5 years on , Americans across the country are still remembering Floyd and seeking answers and reforms to the rather pressing issue of racial injustice in America . At religious services , concerts , and vigils held nationwide , thousands are marking the fifth anniversary of George Floyd 's murder . Concerts , worship service , and other forms of commemorations were held at George Floyd Square in Minneapolis . On Sunday , Floyd 's family gathered in their hometown of Houston near his graveside for a prayer service . Civil rights activists and leaders join the demonstrations in numbers demanding police and judicial reforms that protect black people , minorities , and those defenseless in America against atrocities . They also signal a distinct shift in narrative in the United States of America that changed its tone from safeguarding black lives to championing the cause for white grievance . of the nation to continue to fight for federal law , stand with Congresswoman Williams and others as we change the law . we need legislation for justice for all Americans rather than a hallucination that there is some genocide against whites in South Africa . The chilling murder of Floyd had sent shock waves across the nation and led to mass demonstrations against racism and police brutality . Many held it as a moment of national reckoning with the issue of racism itself . But 5 years later , where does America stand as far as tackling racial attacks are concerned ? A problem America has grappled for far too long . In the recent past , racial attacks in the US have only risen . In 2023 , a black honor student was shot dead by man based out of Kansas City for mistakenly ringing his doorbell . In 2022 , three men were convicted of racially motivated hate crimes in connection with the killing of a young black man in Georgia . In 2020 , a 26 year old black woman was killed by the Louisville police who forced into a house after midnight and there are many more , thus making it crystal clear that racism and racial attacks are a living reality in the US till date . Have any reforms promised in the wake of Floyd 's death been implemented so far ? And have they brought about the desired changes ? Not quite , it seems . In 2021 , the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act aims to address law enforcement reforms . It failed to pass the bipartisan package in the US Senate . In 2022 , former US President Joe Biden signed an executive order to implement as much of the legislation to promote safe and accountable policing . And a recent poll by Pew Research found that eight out of 10 African - Americans have experienced personal discrimination . Why ? Because of their race or ethnicity . And close to 72 % believe the demonstrations in 2020 did not lead to changes that improve the lives of black people living in the US . In January 2025 , the administration of US President Donald Trump halted police reforms agreements . Many Americans think this has impacted the very course correction that America needed with regards to the treatment meted out to people of color . Floyd 's dying words , I ca n't breathe , that became a rallying cry for justice . It also stood for freedom and dignity of individual lives and honoring him is incomplete without the necessary without the required judicial intervention which is required to address the issue head on . Time is ticking for leaders and voices of authority who need to rise now to the occasion and resolve the differences that divide people then unite . [ Music ]"

Today we 're diving deep . really deep back in time over 200 million years ago to the oceans . . We 're talking about a reptile , a marine reptile that was just well unbelievably massive . . Potentially the largest ever found . That 's what the latest findings suggest . . We 're looking at an ichthyossaur possibly reaching 25 m long . 25 m. That 's hard to wrap your head around . bigger than a lot of whales today . Absolutely . I think blue whale scale roughly . And this was swimming around 202 million years ago during the late triacic period . . So , how did we figure this out ? It sounds a pretty amazing discovery story . It really is . It started back in 2016 in Somerset here in the UK . . A fossil hunter , Paul Disal , found a piece of a giant jawbone . Just one piece initially . . Enough to make him and paleontologist Dean Lomax suspect something huge . They 've published on it in 2018 , but knew they needed well more evidence . . You need more than a fragment to be sure about something that massive . Exactly . And then , incredibly , in 2020 , a father and daughter , Justin and Ruby Reynolds , found another one . Another jawbone . Another piece of giant jawbone . . Similar age , same formation , the Westbury mudstone , but this one was even more complete . Found at Blue Anchor , not far from the first find near Lilto . That 's amazing luck . So that second find was the key . It seems to be it really helped confirm the sheer scale of this thing . It allowed them to confidently describe it as a new genus and species . And it has a name now . It does . Ichthyotin severencis . Ichthyotin fish titan . Sounds about . Does n't it just And it 's significant because it 's the first properly named giant ichxiosaur from this specific time , the ration age , at the end of the triacic . So , this giant lived just before a major shakeup . Precisely . Dr. Lomx pointed out it lived up until that big intriacic mass extinction event . And interestingly , ichthyossaurs survived , but they never ever got that big again . . So , this was the peak for giant ichthyosaurs . . It seems it might have been . a high point before that extinction changed things . It really shows how much is still out there to find , does n't it ? . And how important amateur fossil hunters are . Absolutely . That collaboration between Paul de Lasal , the Reynolds family , and the scientists Dr. Lomax , it was crucial . Incredible . Thinking about a 25 meter reptile ruling the seas millions of years before the huge dinosaurs on land . Just . Really paints a picture of those ancient oceans . A very different world full of giants we 're only just starting to fully appreciate . , that 's all we have time for on this dive .

Russia has unleashed its largest drone assault to date . While Ukraine is hitting back with bold attacks of its own as the violence intensifies and escalates , both sides are trading blows as warnings from world leaders grow louder . Our next report telling you more . The night sky over Ukraine pierced by the ominous buzz of drones and missiles as Russia initiated its largest aerial offensive since the invasion began . Russia launched a record shattering drone barrage against Ukraine . In a single night , 355 Shahid type drones and decoys rain down across the country , marking the most extensive drone strike since the war began . Ukrainian air force says Moscow 's forces launched 9 KH 101 cruise missile from TU95MS bomber planes . The relentless deadly assault targeted cities from Odessa to Kev , rocked by explosions and fires . Ukraine 's air defenses were pushed to the brink , intercepting wave after wave of drones and cruise missiles . In KKE , Russian forces intensified the pressure with a combination of glide bombs , drones , and artillery , hitting multiple districts and leaving destruction in their wake . The renewed wave of attacks came after US President Donald Trump called Vladimir Putin absolutely crazy and warned Moscow of new sanctions if the attacks continued . , I 'll give you an update . I 'm not happy with what Putin 's doing . He 's killing a lot of people and I do n't know what the hell happened to Putin . I 've known him a long time . Always gotten along with him , but he 's sending rockets into cities and killing people and I do n't it at all . , we 're in the middle of talking and he 's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities . I do n't it at all . The Kremlin brushed off Trump 's remarks , calling them emotional overload . But tensions are clearly rising , not just on the battlefield , but on the world stage . Ukraine did not sit idle . Military intelligence released footage of a daring drone strike on a Russian military fuel train in occupied Zapurisia , igniting a massive fireball . Kev is sending a clear message that it is willing to take the fight beyond its borders . Amid the chaos , Russia and Ukraine completed their largest prisoner swap yet , exchanging 1,000 captives each . Still , Moscow has rejected calls for a ceasefire , determined to keep pushing forward . As both sides escalate their attacks , the world is left watching a conflict that shows no sign of slowing down . Euron World is one . [ Music ]"

And the reasons may just surprise you . According to the study , men are more likely to develop melanoma , which is the deadliest form of skin cancer on their torso , back , chest , and abdomen . Meanwhile , for women , melanomas are found on lower limbs from the hips to the feet . Researchers believe that the pattern is influenced by typical clothing choices . Now , last year , the rates of melanoma skin cancer reached an all - time high in the United Kingdom with new diagnosis increasing by a quarter from 21 to 28 in every 100,000 people . That 's between 2007 and 2009 and 2017 and 2019 . Melanoma skin cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United Kingdom and the number of cases has been increasing over the last few decades . According to Cancer Research UK , the primary cause is excessive UV radiation which is the main risk factor for melanoma . Cancer Research UK reports that 85 % of melanomas in the United Kingdom are caused by excessive UV radiation , UV exposure and this is partly due to more people being exposed to intense sunlight on holidays abroad . While UV exposure is the main cause , other factors family history and having too many moles can also increase the risk of melanoma . Despite the rise in skin cancer cases , there 's also some good news . Skin cancer mortality is decreasing . According to the study , nine in 10 adults diagnosed with melanoma will survive the disease for 10 years or more . What is also important to note here is that prevention is of course better than early detection . By practicing sun safety , we can stop melanoma cases happening at all . [ Music ]"
https://youtu.be/g99MIl31ba8?si=d80xW99ZdGDNylGQ,China's Fujian Carrier On Sea Trials,Wion,g99MIl31ba8,", China is continuing to push the boundaries of naval warfare , its most sophisticated aircraft carrier . The Fujian has entered what reports are calling its most intensive sea trial so far , the eighth in a series of rigorous maritime tests . What 's more , according to state media , China 's fifth generation stealth jets , the catapult launch capable J35s have also carried out tests and flights . However , the state media reports did not specify if the J35 jets were launched from the Fujian . The trials come at a time when Chinese military activity is surging in the South China Sea and with tensions escalating in the region . From China 's perspective , the Fujian 's capabilities carry even more strategic weight . Let 's tell you more about this . Measuring nearly 316 m in length and weighing over 80,000 tons , the Fujian has the distinction of being the largest conventionally powered warship ever built . Commissioned in June 2022 as China 's third carrier , it stands apart as the first to feature electromagnetic catapult launch systems , a technology that places it in direct competition with America 's Gerald R. Ford class carriers capable of deploying up to 70 aircraft including the J15 multi - roll fighters and anti - ubmarine Z9C helicopters . The Fujian reportedly has two aircraft elevators , three electromagnetic catapults and four arresting wires to recover aircraft returning from missions . The warship also has short range surfaceto - air missile system and autoc cannons to counter incoming missiles and aircraft . Its electromagnetic launch system reportedly enables it to launch heavier planes more frequently , potentially allowing fighter jets to be fully loaded with fuel and armaments . According to state media , the catapult also enables the launch of different sizes of drones . Strategically , the Fujian empowers China to extend its military footprint well beyond its coastline . The carrier strengthens China 's ability to sustain operations across the Indoacific , including the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait . Currently , there is no official date about when the Fujian will formally join the Chinese Navy . But with the Fujian entering an advanced stage of trials and the PLA assessing how combat ready it truly is , the warship is likely to enforce recalibration of strategies across the Indo - Pacific .

With millions of Chinese men struggling to find wives at home , many are now reportedly turning towards Russia and other former Soviet countries . But what 's driving this unusual trend ? The answer lies in numbers and culture . China 's long - standing one child policy combined with a deeprooted cultural preference for boys that has now created a sharp gender imbalance . According to China 's National Bureau of Statistics , men outnumber women by an estimated 30 million . Too many men and too few women . That has also increased the cost of marriage . In rural China , grooms are expected to provide up to $ 83,000 worth of cash . jewelry or property for a bride and Russia where there are reportedly around 10 million more women than men . It has now become a hot spot for international matchmaking . This has led to the development of a new industry where marriage agents offer their services especially on Dion . Now that 's the Chinese version of Tik Tok . It 's an app and other social media platforms . Chat groups are filled with young men who are now exchanging advice on finding partners in Russia , Ukraine and beyond . But such services are also leading to scams . China 's embassy in Bangladesh has now issued a warning against matchmaking services that promise foreign brides for a fee and urged Chinese citizens not to fall for scams that could cost them both emotionally and financially . Meanwhile , marriage rates continue to drop within China . Last year , China saw its lowest number of marriage registration since 1980 . The country registered around 6.1 million marriages , a decline of more than 20 % from 2023 . So perhaps it appears modern realities are rewriting the rules of finding a partner . And for millions of Chinese men , it appears that the road to marriage might just start with a passport . [ Music ]"

Today we 're doing a bit of a deep dive into something pretty cool happening up in the sky . A celestial wanderer making a return after what nearly 75 years . That 's . Almost 3/4 of a century . We 're talking about the comet 12p . Punsbrooks . Puns Brooks . . And some people are calling it the devil comet . We should probably get into that . Definitely . And it 's just recently been visible down in the Australian night sky . So , our mission today is to figure out what makes this particular comet tick , why it 's got that nickname , and why everyone 's buzzing about its return . Sounds good . , first off , the official name 12 Pawns Brooks tells you a bit already . Pawns and Brooks are the astronomers who independently discovered it . Jean Louie Ponds and William Robert Brooks . , independent discoveries . . Exactly . And the 12P means it 's the 12th periodic comet identified . Periodic meaning it comes back around ales . Precisely . It 's on a regular relatively regular orbit around the sun . Not a one - off visitor . How regular are we talking ? It 's roughly about 71 years per orbit give or take . So , quite a weight between appearances . 71 years . So the last time folks saw this was a long time ago indeed . And its journey is , , significantly influenced by Jupiter 's gravity . . So Jupiter nudges it along its big nudge . . Jupiter 's gravity really shapes that long elliptical orbit and affects how close it comes to us and ultimately how visible it might be . ? Which brings us back to that nickname devil comet . That sounds dramatic . Where does that come from ? It 's mainly because it 's known for these sudden outbursts . It 's cryovanic . Cry volcanic . So ice volcanoes . . Instead of just steadily releasing gas and dust as it warms up many comets , pawns brooks can have these pretty significant eruptions spewing out lots more gas and dust quite suddenly . , hence the devilish unpredictability maybe . That 's part of it . And also these outbursts can temporarily change its appearance sometimes creating shapes that people thought look horns though that 's more paridolia horns . , now the name makes even more sense . And there 's another distinctive thing . Its color . It often has a noticeable greenish hue . That 's because it 's the fuzzy atmosphere around the nucleus contains diatomic carbon C2 . Datomic carbon . . And when sunlight hits that molecule , it flueses , emitting this characteristic green light . It 's quite striking . So you 've had sudden eruptions in a green glow . That 's quite the spectacle . Definitely stands out . And remember , comets this are well leftovers . Leftovers from what ? from the formation of the solar system billions of years ago . They 're frozen time capsules , these dirty snowballs , ? Dirty snowball analogy . Ice , dust , rock . Exactly . Preserved material from way back then . So studying them gives us clues about the early solar systems conditions and how things formed . Fascinating . So after what 70 71 years out in the cold , this greenish eruptive dirty snowball is swinging back our way thanks in part to Jupiter . That 's the gist of it . . And the hope is as it gets closer , it might even become bright enough for potential naked eye viewing soon . Though comets are notoriously fickle . Fingers crossed then . A unique visitor offering a glimpse into the past . Really cool stuff . , that 's our look at 12 ft ponds Brooks . Stay tuned to the Beyond podcast for more of such intriguing stories to come ."

Food , energy , and transport prices are n't weighing too heavily on household budgets for now . But still , there 's caution in the air .

https://youtu.be/mcf4EkTCsyg?si=tHhRnlu1j3UyIYWA,US Importers Pay Record $16.5 Bn As April Tariff Bill Lands ,Wion,mcf4EkTCsyg,"Payments by importers of US custom duties rose to a record $ 16.5 billion for goods received in April . The full weight of President Donald Trump 's tariffs has started to come down heavily on companies . But the surge in customs and certain excise tariffs is on the basic 10 % global tariffs imposed by Trump . In the next report , we decode if the math is on the Republicans 's pledge to pay for tax cuts from tariffs . Take a look . Just when everyone were tuning out the trade war , Trump was at it again on Friday . The US president said trade negotiations with the EU are going nowhere . And as such , he threatened to impose 50 % tariffs . What does that mean ? In simple terms , let 's say a firm imports European perfume , which currently costs $ 1,000 . then the price of that rises to $ 1,500 . While Trump unveiled reciprocal tariffs on goods from almost every country on the liberation day in April , he paused them for trade deal negotiations . Still , he left the basic 10 % import duties on all goods coming into the US . That tariff pushed customs collections to a record high of $ 16.5 billion in April . But the real question here is who pays for it ? The US firm importing the product and eventually the US consumer . Trump wants Americans to use made in the US products by pushing prices of imported goods higher . While that is bad for exporting countries , costs of goods for Americans also shoot up . Trump and Republicans had pledged that tariffs will pay for record GOP tax cuts . However , the math does n't add up . The tariff rates being collected consist mostly of a 10 % baseline tariff for most of the world , a 25 % duty on steel and aluminum , and 25 % on autos . The tariff rate on China was about 20 % when Trump took office , hit a high of 145 % , and is now 51 % with monthly collections for April . Now accounted for , the Treasury will bring in at least $ 22.3 billion in customs duties and other excise taxes this month , which will be another record . Still , if tariffs continue at the present rate , the data suggests that Trump will fall short . The math shows that Trump will come up short of the $ 2 billion . a day in tariff revenue he 's counting on to help pay for the record tax cuts included in a bill passed by the House of Representatives this week . More importantly , Trump 's tariff goals are also a moving target as we have seen in recent weeks .

Bank of America data shows Gen Z households spend about 2.8 times more on fitness than baby boomers , while millennials spend around three times as much .

In February , US retail sales rose just 0.2 % 2 % missing expectations , but spending at fitness centers grew 7 % year - on - year , which is the biggest jump in 19 months . Analysts believe that this reflects a long - term prioritization of fitness , activity based leisure , and wellness focused discretionary purchases among Gen Z and millennials , even as overall household budgets tighten . While this younger cohort is also reshaping consumption patterns , alcohol spending is declining among jenziers and millennials . Non - alcoholic beer and sleds sales have outpaced alcoholic versions for four straight years .

Now , on the surface , the defense seems justified . , China holds a $ 300 billion trade surplus with the United States , exporting crucial products smartphones , industrial machinery , and rare earth minerals used in advanced technologies . Nearly 40 % of US imports from China are manufacturing components essential to American factories . , this means tariffs disrupt not only consumers but also key sectors manufacturing and agriculture . Additionally , major economies such as Japan , India , and Australia trade more with China than the United States , making Chinese goods difficult to replace globally . While China 's global role as a manufacturing hub and its control over supply chains give it strategic leverage in the trade conflict . The country 's strong nationalist sentiment reinforced by state media and controlled information help sustain public support for the government 's policies despite economic hardships . However , beneath this facade , the average Chinese citizen earns less than $ 6,000 a year in disposable income , reflecting limited domestic demand and rising economic vulnerabilities . China 's impressive growth masks serious structural weaknesses . The economy is burdened by massive debt . Overinvestment in real estate , infrastructure and manufacturing has created huge excess capacity and waste . Now this is exemplified by millions of empty or unfinished apartments flowing the property market collapse . Now social protections remain minimal especially for rural migrant workers restricted by the hook residency system limiting access to the healthare systems and education along with pensions . Recent openness to tariff talks suggest the government recognizes these pressures but remains cautious fearing painful reforms that could destabilize the system . [ Music ]"

Australia 's southeast is drowning in disaster . Relentless rain has triggered flash floods . cut off towns and left thousands stranded . And what began as a heavy downpour has now become a record - breaking catastrophe . Rural communities across New South Wales are the worst hit . In the Hunter and Midn North Coast regions , entire streets have vanished underwater . Towns Tari , Glenthon , Kempy , Port McQuire , Coffs Harbor , and Belingen are now disaster zones . We 've got an incredibly volatile situation . I said a few days ago that this will break some records and these are n't the records that you want to break , but we 've seen more rain and more flooding in the mid and to north coast area than we 've ever seen before . We 've seen an impact that 's affecting the tens of thousands of people . In just 24 hours , some areas received more than 300 mm of rain , which is four times the average monthly rainfall .

This natural disaster has been terrible for this community . It 's affected a wide number of people . It 's affected tens of thousands of houses and as a result we are bracing for more bad news . In response at least 14 evacuation centers have opened across the flood hit regions . They offer shelter support and emergency supplies but access remains a major issue .

Police and protesters locked horns outside the Argentine Congress leaving dozens of people injured . Video show security forces pushing through the crowd in Boness with riot shields and batons as activists and elderly cit citizens were singing , chanting , and protesting demanding higher pensions . The protests outside the Congress erupted as lawmakers failed to meet the necessary quorum to vote on several bills , including proposals for pension increases and continuity of benefits for retirees . Only 124 lawmakers attended out of the necessary 129 while 133 were absent . Opposition lawmakers accused their peers of complying with the government of President Javier Malay 's austerity measures . The opposition accuses the Malay government of killing those collecting minimum wage . so many times before , I 'm here with a minority defending pensioners . Without any speculations , I 'm here defending pensioners because I think that the House of Democracy can not be indifferent when pensioners are earning 379,000 pesos , $ 330 . This must cause pain in our guts and we must stop speculating how much more I can continue to do nothing hoping to get a government position . Recently we also saw an embarrassing scene . Lawmakers laughing that this session fell through in order to keep the government 's plans on track . The government 's plan is evidently to kill of hunger millions collecting minimum wage . President Malay 's government , which has sought to improve the economy and tackle painfully high inflation by cutting down public spending , has opposed both proposals to increase pensions and to continue benefits for retirees . In its defense , the government said it is in order to increase pensions , wages and contributions from workers must also increase . It also says that it reduces its resources are limited and to increase pensions the country must first see more investment and economic growth . I must give you an obvious answer to your question . In order to increase pensions we must have better salaries and increase contribution from workers that is achieved by one condition investment and growth . There is no other way of doing this because our resources are limited . Around 38 % of the people or 11.3 million were in poverty in the second half of last year . Now , President Javier Malay 's austerity drive has triggered weekly protest in the capital with workers , unions , and soccer fans joining retirees to protest pension cuts amid stubborn inflation and reduced public spending . Last month , a nationwide strike against spending cuts severely disrupted transport with all domestic flights being cancelled and trains and metro services suspended in Buenesis . President Malay has slashed subsidies for transport , fuel , and energy and has fired tens of thousands of public servants and also closed government departments . So far , his plans seem to have worked with inflation down from over 200 % to about 60 % a year . But the unions and retirees say the most vulnerable have been hit the hardest . So the question becomes , will President Malay be able to continue his austerity drive . Or will public pressure force him to find an alternative to fix the economy ?

In multiple areas across the strip , protesters openly blamed Hamas for the destruction , famine , and suffering amid the ongoing war with Israel . Chants such as Hamas 's garbage , we did n't choose Hamas and all of Hamas out , were heard in multiple neighborhoods in a rare display of defiance amid fears of retaliation . [ Applause ] In recent months , protests against Hamas have been on the rise in northern Gaza , but activists reportedly say that the group 's presence in the south has remained strong and it successfully suppressed public descent until now . Now , reports indicate that the protest began on Monday , led by young people , and grew as others joined while lining up at community kitchens for food . [ Applause ] [ Music ] [ Applause ] [ Music ] [ Music ] Now , these demonstrations come as Gaza struggles with a deepening humanitarian crisis and a war that shows no signs of ending . After an 11week blockade , Israel has finally allowed nearly 200 aid trucks into Gaza this week , carrying flour , baby food , and medical supplies . Visuals from Gaza shown show war hit Palestinians unloading flour from one of the trucks . Take a look . Yet , UN officials and locals say little of that aid has reached Gaza 's hungry population due to security issues , fears of looting , and distribution breakdowns . People come since 7:00 a.m. They do not find anything . As you can see , all of their pots are empty . All of them , all the people of Gaza come here to the soup kitchen . There is no flour , no food , nothing . We want to live . We are hungry . Everyone is making promises . Aid will enter . There is no aid or anything . Meanwhile , Israel has continued its military offensive in Gaza with more strikes . And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the war will continue until Hamas is disarmed completely and the Palestinian enclave is under the Israeli military 's control . Our forces are capturing more and more territories to clear them of terrorists and Hamas terror infrastructure . And at the end of this process , all of the Gaza Strip will be under Israeli security control , and Hamas will be completely defeated . Now , since March , Israel has targeted what it calls militant infrastructure , including tunnels and rocket launchers across the Palestinian enclave . The resumption of the assault on Gaza since March following a two - month ceasefire has drawn condemnation from countries including Britain and Canada that have long been cautious about openly criticizing Israel . Even the United States , Israel 's most important ally , has reportedly shown signs of losing patience with Prime Minister Netanyahu . And there 's also growing unease within Israel over continuation of the war while several hostages still remain in captivity in Gaza . So with both Hamas and Israel refusing to shift their positions , peace talks remain in a deadlock . But inside Gaza , a different message is growing , growing louder .

https://youtu.be/XgCQyFXz9J8?si=9iTy9Wz-kCuWdqyA,"Budget Airlines Could Introduce ""Standing Seats"" From 2026",Firstpost,XgCQyFXz9J8,"There was a time when flying was the height of human sophistication . The 1960s called it the jet age and for good reason . Flying was a luxury experience . The journey was as exciting as the destination . People dressed up to fly . Passengers sipped champagne from glasses . Food was served on linen draped tray tables . Armrests were big enough for actual arms . Fast forward to today and you 're lucky if your knees do n't double as a tray table because flying has gone through some serious change . Flights are crowded . Leg room has vanished . Meals have gone extinct . But there was still one relief . There is one relief . At least you 're still sitting down . Although that may not last for long because the next frontier in budget air travel is standing seats or more accurately leaning perches . It 's a half squat situation . You 're neither sitting nor standing . You 're hanging in the middle of the air . We hope it 's not as uncomfortable as it sounds and looks . The seats are called Sky Rider 2.0 . They were first unveiled in 2018 and since then the design has evolved . The latest version has met all the safety checks apparently . So , it has been approved . This seat is safe enough to fly in , which is why budget airlines are now eyeing it . The question is why ? How did we get here ? How did we go from luxury travels to half squatting in planes ? First came the shrinking seats , then the disappearing meals , then the hidden baggage fees . The skies got crowded , the margins got thinner , and in recent years , the pressure on airlines has only intensified . Fuel prices have soared , emissions regulations are tightening . So now the game is all about efficiency . Less weight , more passengers , maximum profit . And that 's where these seats come in . The Sky Rider is being considered for short hall flights . Anything less than 2 hours . It weighs 50 % less than normal seats . The maintenance is much cheaper , so chances are it can be part of planes as early as 2026 , which is next year . And airlines are pitching it as an option , not a punishment . You want a cheaper ticket ? , then you can perch . But what this semi - standing seat can not prevent is turbulence . Turbulence in the skies . Look at this indigo flight . On Wednesday , it was flying from New Delhi to Shinagar . It encountered massive turbulence . There are videos on social media . You can see shaking seats and passengers in distress . The flight announced an emergency . When it landed in Sinagar , it had a broken nose . The aircraft 's nose suffered damage . And this is not an isolated incident , although it 's quite dramatic . In the last four decades , severe turbulence has gone up significantly . It 's been it 's up by almost 55 % . And scientists say this is because of climate change . Warmer air from emissions is changing how jet streams work . So plane rides will become more bumpy . Turbulence is also terrible for airlines . Every year it costs the airline industry up to $ 500 million . So when airlines tell us that standing seats are safe , you will have to forgive us for taking it with a pinch of salt . , there 's a seat belt . , it 's past inspections . But what happens when the planes start shaking ? The contrast is both stark and unsettling . On one hand , airlines are pushing us upright to save space and money . On the other , skies are getting rowdier . There 's a poetic misalignment here less lifeboats on a ship headed towards stormy waters . Is this the future we asked for ? Airlines can argue that this is about consumer choices that if people want to fly , it is their choice . And I agree it is . But that does not change the paradox of modern air travel . We are flying faster and further . We are flying more than ever before . Yet the experience can not be more primitive . So , buckle up or maybe do n't just hold on tight to that pole . Either way , it 's going to be a bumpy ride . At first post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy . That means we wo n't always be first . We may not get you your breaking alert . But what you will get is what we owe you . And that is the truth . Verified , checked , and cross - cheed . We rely on sources and verified ones .

This week , one Bitcoin was trading at over $ 111,000 . $ 111,000 . It 's an all - time high . It is no longer just the geeks who are buying . Wall Street is driving this rally . So are the big banks . They 're offering Bitcoin ETFs . That 's exchangeraded funds built for Bitcoin . Regulation in the US is loosening and the financial world is taking notice . But here is what makes this rally different . Bitcoin is moving up even as the American stock markets fall . And that is a significant shift . Investors now see Bitcoin not just as a risk but as a reserve . Crypto is not a sideshow anymore . It is part of the main act . Our next report tells you how Bitcoin is on fire . The cryptocurrency is breaking records again . Yesterday , one Bitcoin was worth $ 111,000 . This is a new all - time high . Some years ago , this number seemed unthinkable . Today , it 's a reality . And it 's not just a price spike . It 's a signal that Bitcoin is no longer on the fringe . It 's moving into the mainstream . What 's driving this rally ? It is a combination of a few factors . First , momentum . When value of crypto assets rise , more investors pile in . They want to ride the wave . Second , regulation . Washington is starting to warm up to crypto . The Trump administration is bullish on cryptocurrencies . Trump himself has endorsed these digital assets . In March , he announced the creation of a crypto reserve . He 's even appointed a cryptozar . His name is David Saxs . He 's pushing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies and that matters because government participation brings stability and stability brings bigger players . The third reason is demand from Wall Street . The institutional investors , banks , funds , asset managers . They are buying into Bitcoin . They have found a new gateway to invest Bitcoin ETFs . So , what is a Bitcoin ETF ? It 's a fund that holds Bitcoin and allows people to buy shares in it a stock without having to own Bitcoin directly . It 's easier , safer , and managed by experts . People are buying into these ETFs in large numbers . According to some claims , they have attracted $ 40 billion in inflows . Where is the money coming from ? From individuals to big investors alike . Black Rockck is one of the companies to offer a Bitcoin ETF . Just recently , the ETF 's rank jumped from number 47 to 5 . This fund is now the fifth largest by inflows . Last month , investors have pumped in some $ 6.5 billion into this ETF . The message is clear . Investors of all ages and sizes are feeling confident about Bitcoin . This includes major banks as well JP Morgan . Institutions that once mocked Bitcoin are now offering it to clients . Jaime Diamond , the CEO of JP Morgan , used to call Bitcoin a fraud . This week , his bank approved Bitcoin purchases for clients . It 's a shift that 's difficult to ignore . And here 's what makes this more interesting . Bitcoin is rallying while US stock markets are falling . In the past , Bitcoin moved in line with tech stocks . When NASDAQ went down , Bitcoin went down . This time , it 's moving on its own . And that 's important because it means investors are thinking of Bitcoin as a store of value . Not just a risky bet , but a reserve . Bitcoin is n't just rallying . It 's redefining its role . Once seen as a rebel currency , it 's now part of portfolios , bank strategies , and investment plans . It 's going from experimental to essential . You still may not want to risk your money with it . But whether you love it or hate it , Bitcoin is quickly making its mark on the mainstream .

https://youtu.be/Qbjk24hpumM?si=XH82Xxb5W_NQWQr7,India-US Trade Talks: Racing Against Trump’s Deadline ,Firstpost,Qbjk24hpumM,"Heat . Heat . Now let 's talk about the India US trade deal . The clock is ticking . Both sides are racing against time . Trump had set a deadline , the 8th of July . If the deal is not done by then , a new round of tariffs would kick in . And the US president has some bold expectations . He wants a deal with zero tariffs . very hard to sell into India and they 've offered us a deal where they 're willing to charge us no tariff . India has not committed to anything that but it remains engaged with the Trump administration . Earlier this week , PJ Go was in Washington DC . He is India 's commerce minister . He 's the one who has been negotiating with Trump 's team and he met them again this week . So what came out of it ? Are we close to a deal ? As things stand , both sides are pushing for an interim agreement , something they can sign before the 8th of July . That is the priority now . Negotiations are underway on several fronts , goods , services , and digital trade . India is open to discussing non - trade barriers as well , but it expects concessions in return . And on this front , New Delhi 's priorities are clear . It wants to protect the labor intensive sectors , industries textile and leather . India seeking concessions for them . It also wants to secure some sensitive sectors agriculture and dairy . For these , India could push for a kota or a minimum support price . The best case scenario would be a zero tariff trade regime . But there 's a roadblock . The Trump administration can not unilaterally bring down tariffs . For that it needs approval from the US Congress . That is the American Parliament . They must approve and that would take time . If this deal goes to the US Congress , it wo n't be signed anytime soon . So India wants to keep it simple . India 's ask from the Trump administration is this . Just remove the 26 % additional tariffs , the ones that Trump imposed in April . Remove them . That 's the ask . An interim deal . No congressional approval and no delays , just a fast and focused agreement that gets both sides across the finish line quickly because both India and the US want to win . So this should not be a tough cell and yet it 's not done till it 's done . So we should prepare for all scenarios . What if the deal does not happen ? What if they do not meet the deadline ? What happens then ? The prospect should not worry India too much . That is the assessment of ratings agency Moody 's . They have released a new report . It says India is better placed than most emerging economies . Trump 's tariffs may slow down growth , but the Indian economy should be able to absorb the shock . India has a strong domestic market . It has a low dependence on exports and robust growth driven by internal factors . In fact , Moody says even if the US imposes tariffs , India wo n't suffer significant economic damage . That should be encouraging . At the same time , resilience can not be an excuse for stagnation . India does not want to just survive this . It wants to expand its trade and for that it is looking beyond the United States . India is negotiating with a wide range of countries . Some deals have already been signed .

While the Trump administration is granting asylum to white South Africans , it is simultaneously deporting migrants from other countries to Africa 's South Sudan . A US judge has ruled that the Trump administration unquestionably violated a court order by putting several individuals on a deportation flight to South Sudan . Now , this comes just hours after the administration announced it had expelled eight immigrants from countries including Cuba , Laos , Mexico , Myanmar , and Vietnam , all convicted of violent crimes . South Sudan has stated it has not received any of these migrants . The police said it would investigate and rroot any deportes to their actual countries of origin . say is when they arrive we do n't preempt when they arrive they will be investigated the truth will be established and it will be again reported to the correct country this is what will be likely done the result of the investigation will determine the action now this response came as the US department of homeland security claimed it had found a nation willing to accept what it called vicious illegal aliens It described the deportes as convicted murderers , rapists , and pedophiles and asserted they had been warned repeatedly about deportation . However , some migrants claimed that they were notified only hours before removal . The US has yet to confirm the migrants current locations , suggesting South Sudan may not be their final destination . We found a nation that was willing to accept custody of these vicious illegal aliens . We are removing these convicted criminals from American so soil so they can never hurt another American victim , an American man , child , or woman . While we are fully compliant with the law and court orders , it is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try to dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America . Days ago , a US judge had blocked deportations to third countries following reports that migrants could be sent to Libya , a war torn country plagued by migrant abuse for over a decade . Meanwhile , South Sudan , the world 's youngest nation , has faced ongoing violence since gaining independence in 2011 . Between 2013 and 2018 , civil war claimed nearly 400,000 lives . The US State Department continues to warn against all travel to South Sudan , citing extreme risks of crime , kidnapping , and armed conflict . Last month , the Trump administration revoked visas for all South Sudin passport holders after immigration officials in Juba refused to repatriate a deport . Washington accused South Sudan of taking advantage of the United States . South Sudan initially claimed the individual at the center of the dispute was a citizen of neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo . However , it later agreed to accept him . The Trump administration is also currently in talks with multiple countries to accept migrants deported from the US . Rwanda has confirmed such negotiations are underway . Other countries mentioned in media reports include Benin , Angola , Equatorial Guinea , and Esatini . In fact , several Western nations are actively exploring or implementing policies to deport migrants to third countries . The UK tried to ink a deal with Rwanda , but that did not work . Other than countries Denmark and the Netherlands have also explored such deals with African nations . But such plans have raised multiple legal and ethical concerns for African nations . These deals pose significant humanitarian burdens along with serious questions about national sovereignity . Is Africa prepared to accept deportes from the western world ?

https://youtu.be/JPaYsRG2S9M?si=LQzL9ubVWWCRs8l0,UK Signs Multibillion Dollar Chagos Deal With Mauritius ,Firstpost,JPaYsRG2S9M,"While while the US courts are blocking Trump 's deportation orders , UK judges have now lifted an injunction that halted a major treaty at the last minute . It is the Chargers deal between the UK and Maitius , which was due to be signed earlier today . Now Britain can now finalize its deal with Maitius on the future of the Charus Islands after a high court judge in London overturned an 11th hour injunction that had blocked the agreement . The UK Prime Minister Kier Stalmer was scheduled to sign the agreement virtually transferring sovereignity of the Charus Islands to Maitius . The court has now cleared the way for the deal to be signed immediately . Under the deal , Maitius would gain control of the strategic archipelago , while the UK would retain a joint US UK military base on Diego Garcia for 99 years . Britain would also pay Maitius reportedly around $ 4 billion to secure the base 's future . After months of negotiations , the deal was set for final signing today . But a judge issued an injunction yesterday after a legal challenge by two British nationals born on the islands . The petitioners raised objections that they were not told that the deal would be signed today . They say that they were not part of the consultations and they have expressed doubts over Maitius 's intentions , arguing that there are , excuse me , no guarantees for resettlement or compensation . Now , they claimed that the Chagosians would gain nothing unless they apply for Maitian citizenship . But in overturning the injunction , the court ruled that granting or continuing the court order would seriously harm the UK 's public interest and therefore should not be maintained . The UK government welcomed the ruling , calling the deal vital to protect the British people and our national security . Now , this is n't the first time that the deal faced obstacles . The agreement was initially reached in October of last year , but the current Maitian government reopened talks , citing concerns over lease terms , financial structure , and uncertainty over how former President Trump might respond to the arrangement . Now , some critics in the UK , especially conservatives , warned the deal could threaten the joint base , calling it a national security risk . Amid these debates , the Chagasian voices were largely sidelined . Between 1968 and 1973 , over 1,500 Chagasians were forcibly removed by the UK to make way for the US base on Diego Garcia . The islands were detached from Maitius just before it gained independence in 1968 . The displacement was devastating . Entire communities were evicted often without warning and sent to Maitius and Sey Shells where many lived in extreme poverty . Britain offered limited compensation in the 1980s but did not issue a formal apology for decades . Resettlement was promised several times only to be repeatedly denied . While the Chagasian 's issue remains after a long and fraught back and forth , the Chaga deal is now officially back on track . At first post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy .

https://youtu.be/ZgsUT0GkaI0?si=HDZo8TPiPgR2KRIZ,"New Zealand's ""Golden Visa"" Applications Surge, Americans Top the List ",Firstpost,ZgsUT0GkaI0,"And for our last story today , let 's turn our attention to New Zealand , where the demand for its golden visas has increased sharply in the past six weeks under new looser rules . What 's worth noting here is the majority of the new applications are coming from the United States . The Golden Visa rules were eased in February as a part of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon 's government 's efforts to revitalize the nation 's economy . The new scheme , which came into effect in April , includes some key changes , and these include the removal of English language requirements and a reduction in the investment threshold for the growth visa to approximately $ 3 million US . The required time applicants must spend in New Zealand to establish residency has also been reduced from three years to just 21 days . The application process has also been cut to 11 days on average . Now , these changes appear to be having a tangible impact . According to New Zealand 's immigration department , the revamped program has already attracted 65 new applications in the past six weeks and 55 of these new applications came from the Donald Trump less . Now , this surge in interest from the US has prompted speculation about the underlying reasons . Experts suggest that the reelection of Donald Trump as the president is a significant catalyst . Experts believe that the uncertainty surrounding Trump administration 's next move is prompting many wealthy Americans of differing political persuasions to seek residency abroad . Analysts also point to New Zealand benefiting from other countries , tightening their own golden visa programs , and the broader geopolitical instability , including the situation in Europe . Previous iterations of New Zealand 's investment visa program face scrutiny . In 2018 , former Prime Minister Justinda Arden tightened the rules after concerns arose , particularly following the controversial granting of citizenship to billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Theel . Now , this sparked a national debate about the scale and this of land and housing sales to wealthy foreign individuals seeking a safe haven . Currently , only New Zealand residents , Australians , and Singaporeans are permitted to buy property in the country . Prime Minister Luxen 's government is now actively working to reverse many of the previous administration 's policies , including easing the restrictions on foreign investment . Beyond economic factors , New Zealand 's lifestyle and political stability are also proving to be strong draws . The significant increase in golden visa applications signals a potential influx of foreign investment and highlights New Zealand 's growing appeal as a safe and stable destination in an increasingly uncertain world .

https://youtu.be/V6zv_rXUm8k?si=lIOjROThimH4fLBL,Philippines: Marcos Orders Cabinet Purge After Duterte Camp Shows Midterm Strength,Firstpost,V6zv_rXUm8k,"And moving on to the Philippines , in a stunning political shakeup , President Ferdinand Marcus Jr. has ordered all cabinet secretaries to submit their resignations , calling it a bold reset for his administration . The goal , according to President Marcus , is to overhaul the government and better meet the expectations of the public . The sweeping directive comes in the wake of a disappointing midterm election where Marcus ' camp failed to secure a full sweep of Senate seats , deepening fractures in an already divided legislature . The elections were in part seen as a battle between Marcus and his estranged vice president Sarah Duterte , whose candidates outperformed expectations . Marcus has framed this cabinet overhaul as a response to growing public frustration , promising a harder focus on results . In a statement , Marcus said the cabinet overhaul is not about personalities , but performance , alignment , and urgency . The president said those who have delivered and continue to deliver will be recognized , but there is no place for complacency and the time for comfort zones is over . Referring to the midterm election results , the president said that the people have spoken and they expect results , not politics , not excuses . The timing of the resignations comes at a critical point for the president as his administration has seen a significant drop in public approval . According to a March survey by Pulse Asia , Marcus ' approval rating plummeted to just 25 % . A stark contrast to the 59 % rating enjoyed by Vice President Sarah Duterte . Observers say this dip is due to a series of missteps , including reports linking Marcus administration 's cooperation with Interpol during the arrest of the former president Rodrigo Duterte on an ICC warrant . But towering above all issues is the cost of living crisis and Filipinos are holding their president accountable . Critics argue Marcus has failed to rein in economic pressures , fueling public disillusionment despite inflation technically falling within the central bank 's target range . As President Marcus moves ahead with his cabinet reset , will this gamble help him win back public trust , or will it deepen the cracks within his already fractured administration ? The next few months will be critical as Marcus works to solidify his position in the second half of his six - year term . At First Post , we are choosing to hold onto accuracy .

https://youtu.be/eiFZkIPSxyQ?si=VyAJwfKkZU5JnAPn,"Rubio Says the US Can ""Pick and Choose"" Who Receives Refugee Status",Firstpost,eiFZkIPSxyQ,"And from President Trump 's missile defense system , we now move to another contentious area , America 's refugee policy . In a fiery Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing , Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced sharp criticism from Democratic senators over the Trump administration 's foreign policy decisions . Now , these included issues ranging from refugee admissions and budget cuts to controversial choices in the Middle East , Latin America , and Eastern Europe . Secretary Rubio making his first committee appearance since being confirmed stood firm in defending the administration 's decisions . In fact , he claimed America is back , citing nuclear talks with Iran , tenative peace efforts between Russia and Ukraine and attempts to end the Israel Hamas conflict as signs of diplomatic progress . But Democrat but Democratic senators were far from convinced . In fact , the major flash point was the administration 's decision to suspend most refugee admissions while allowing a group of 59 white Africaners from South Africa to enter under a special refugee program . Senator Tim Kaine led the charge accusing the administration of racial bias . United States has a to pick and choose who they allow into the United States even based on the based upon the color of somebody 's skin . You 're the one that 's talking about the color of their skin , not me . These refusing farms were being burned down and they were killed because of the color of their skin . Senator Chris Van Golland joined in condemning Rubio for creating a system of global apartheid . He also accused the administration of turning away refugees from war torn nations in Africa and Asia while fasttracking those from what he called bogus claims of persecution . And while you 've turned away from a genocide in Sudan and invented one in South Africa , you teamed up with President Trump to throw the Ukrainian people under the bus and had been played a fiddle by Vladimir Putin . Of course , Donald Trump not only said he would end the war in Ukraine on day one , he also said he would end the war in Gaza on day one . The tensions only deepened when Van Holland said he regretted supporting Rubio 's confirmation despite their decadel long cooperation in Congress . And I have to tell you directly and personally that I regret voting for you for Secretary of State . I yield back . , first of all , your regret for voting for me confirms I 'm doing a good job based on what I Republican support for Rubio , however , was more measured . And while committee chair Senator Jim Ris praised the administration 's foreign policy shift and suspending cuts , senior Republicans Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins warned against slashing foreign aid on Millennium Challenge . I think that there were some I saw some reporting out there that it was being imploded . My understanding is the way it 's being approached is that it 's being reformed but not done away with . It was created as an alternative to the way we did aid with USA ID . And so there 's work happening on both of them . So , Secretary Rubio also addressed the humanitarian crisis in Gaza , saying the US is pressuring Israel to resume aid shipments without resorting to sanctions . He also confirmed that discussions are ongoing with foreign governments about temporarily hosting displaced Palestinians . Been involved in any discussions related to deporting people from Gaza , Palestinians in Gaza to Libya ? , there 's no deportation . What what we have talked to some nations about is if someone voluntarily and willingly says I want to go somewhere else for some period of time because I 'm sick because my I my children need to go to school or what have you . On Syria , Rubio warned of an i m imminent collapse of the interim government if US engagement stalls . He reaffirmed the administration 's intent to lift sanctions imposed during the Assad regime to support the new leadership . Good news is that there is a Syrian national identity . It is one of the places in the Middle East where aloises and Drews and Christians and Sunni and Shia have lived along and Kurds have lived alongside each other underneath the banner of a Syrian identity until it was broken by a butcher Assad who pit pitted them against each other . So they face a number of challenges and as South Africa 's president Ramoposa meets with President Donald Trump amid the charged backdrop , one question lingers in the air .

https://youtu.be/rdAr3SoUtww?si=F2x-H0AJMkycX-on,Japanese Minister’s Rice Gaffe Shakes Ishiba Government ,Firstpost,rdAr3SoUtww,"Speaking of crisis , Japan is battling a very serious one . They 're heading for elections in two months . And the government 's biggest adversary is rice , the grain . It is Japan 's staple food , and its price has remained stubbornly high . So much so that it is testing the prime minister 's grip on power . His approval ratings have fallen to a record low . And now his own minister has dealt a blow . He said he 's never had to buy rice because his supporters give him so much . That remark drew so much criticism that the minister had to resign . But the government is still facing a massive backlash . So why has rice become such a major political issue for Japan ? And what does it mean for their government ? Here 's a report . Japan has a sticky rice problem quite and it has cost a minister his job . We 're talking about takuito . Earlier this week , he made an off - the- cuff remark . He said , "" I have never bought rice myself . Frankly , my supporters give me quite a lot of rice . I have so much rice at home that I could sell it . "" Its gaff could not have come at a worse time . Rice is Japan 's prime staple food , but its cost has been soaring for months . After a minor dip in the first week of May , the average retail price has risen to $ 29.4 per 5 kg of rice with prices surging to record highs . Rice has become a major political issue in the country and itto has only added fuel to the fire . He was Japan 's agriculture minister . We say was because he resigned today after a major backlash . I just handed in my resignation to Prime Minister Shageru Oshiba . Personally , I would to apologize again for making an inappropriate comment as the minister in charge while the Japanese people are struggling with rice prices . I believe it was nothing but an inappropriate comment which was due to my lack of understanding of people 's feelings . I think Takuidito 's comment was not acceptable not only because he was the agriculture minister but as a human as if once he took the upper position he forgot about the lower ranked people . I think the resignation is what he deserves . This comes as pressure mounts on the government to solve the nation 's rice crisis . The shortfall began last August . There were warnings of a mega quake . So people started panic buying rice . The problem has persisted for months and now prices are almost twice what they were a year ago . The government has made several attempts to bring prices down dipping into rice reserves and importing rice from South Korea for the first time in a quarter of a century . But nothing has worked . The release of emergency stockpile rice was too late and it has not yet reached us . So I hope the new minister cares about our lives . Now the new minister of agriculture is Shinjiro Koisumi and it 's his job to drive down the rice prices and Japanese Prime Minister Shigaru Ishiba can only hope that it happens fast because rice is just a small part of the buffet of problems he faces . There 's a cost of living crisis . Japan 's financial condition is poor . Ishiba says it 's worse than Greece 's decadel long crisis . And this has hurt the yeshiva government . It was already suffering from low approval ratings and after the mishap they slipped to 27.4 % . A record low . Plus last year 's Liberal Democratic Party suffered a crushing defeat in the lower house election and only held on to power by seeking support from minor parties . It 's not a good look for the party that has ruled Japan for all of its post - war history . And now the threat has worsened ahead of the July elections when the country heads to polls for the upper house . So rice could very well determine Ishiba 's future as prime minister . It has already dented his popularity and Itto 's comment is merely the cherry on top of this rice cake . At first post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy .

https://youtu.be/VX2dCXy1omo?si=xwLb9jA_Zwl1yNLN,Africa Launches First Space Agency in Egypt's Cairo ,Firstpost,VX2dCXy1omo,"And our final story focuses on a major milestone in Africa 's space ambitions . Africa has officially inaugurated its first continental space agency in Cairo , the capital of Egypt . Named the African Space Agency , it is established under the African Union . The agency opened its doors last month and is currently in the process of setting up and hiring key personnel . It will coordinate existing national space programs across the continent . The agency aims to strengthen Africa 's space infrastructure by launching satellites , establishing weather stations , and ensuring data sharing across Africa and beyond . Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to extreme weather events which are worsened by climate change despite contributing far less to global warming than developed countries . Currently , the lack of high resolution weather and climate data hinder governments from issuing timely warnings and scientists face challenges in accurately predicting long - term climate trends due to insufficient data detail . The African Space Agency represents a crucial step toward improving climate resilience , satellite infrastructure , and data sharing across the continent . Several African countries have launched satellites that support agriculture , climate monitoring , communications , and disaster response . But none of these satellites have been launched from African soil . Cairo launched the continent 's first satellite in 1998 and since then more than 20 African nations have established space agencies with 18 of them launching a total of 63 satellites . However , all African satellites to date have been launched from facilities outside the continent , including locations in Russia , Kazakhstan , China , and the United States . The African Space Agency aims to drive continentwide progress by enhancing space infrastructure , expanding satellite capabilities , and improving access to critical data . Its launch comes amid recent cutbacks in US funding following the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development , which had been a significant supporter of development programs in Africa . Despite this , the African Space Agency has already forged partnerships with the European Space Agency , collaborating to train experts and to share knowledge on satellite building and data processing . The global space economy is valued at around $ 469 billion , while Africa 's space industry is projected to grow 16.16 % to 22.64 billion by 2026 . The African Space Agency is poised to be a key driver of this growth and transformation across the continent . At First Post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy .

https://youtu.be/NboiA3tSkPI?si=ddLwmci8ybpf9RbV,Italian PM Meloni Backs Trump's Plan of Vatican Mediating Ukraine Peace Talks ,Firstpost,NboiA3tSkPI,"And for our last story today , let 's turn our attention to the war in Ukraine , where a new potential avenue for peace talks is emerging . Italian Prime Minister George Maloney has backed US President Donald Trump 's suggestion that the Vatican could mediate talks on negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine . This development follows comments from Pope Leo last week . The Pope affirmed the Vatican 's constant readiness to bring opposing sides together and its commitment to making every effort for peace . Despite this , the Holy Sea itself has clarified that the idea of hosting or even mediating talks remains more of a hopeful aspiration than a concrete plan at this stage . Thank you . If direct engagement does resume , Ukraine appears open to the Vatican as a potential host . President Philir Zalinski took to social media platform X on Tuesday to reveal that he had discussed possible platforms for talks with the Russians with Prime Minister Maloney . He noted her cool ideas while also mentioning Turkey and Switzerland as alternative venues for talks . Looking at the current status of the ceasefire negotiations , the two sides have n't made any significant progress . Last week 's meeting between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Istanbul has brought additional demands from Moscow . Beyond the initial terms which were unfavorable to Kiev , Moscow now insists on Kiev recognizing its annexation of four partially occupied regions of Ukraine as well as Crimea . Experts suggest that the Vatican 's potential involvement in the peace talks could possibly lend some extra moral authority into the push for some form of compromise . The Catholic Church has a history of mediating conflicts and has already been involved in efforts to secure prisoner releases and the return of Ukrainian children . Although the extent of its direct impact , remains somewhat unclear . The Vatican 's diplomatic style , known for its quiet and considered approach , stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump 's often blunt public pronouncements . A recent encounter between Trump and Zilinski at Pope Francis 's funeral , where they were seen in close conversation hinted at a possible thawing of their relationship . However , unlike Pope Francis , the current Pope Leo has publicly condemned Russia 's invasion as an imperialist war and has denounced the crimes committed by the Russian forces . Experts suggest that the question of whether the Vatican can effectively facilitate meaningful peace talks hinges on factors far deeper than the choice of venue or the style of negotiations . It depends on a fundamental shift in the positions and priorities of both Russia and Ukraine and the willingness of international actors to exert pressure toward a resolution .

https://youtu.be/6cwznbP6POI?si=Cva5MjsvakLmkYlp,US Intel Suggests Israel is Possibly Planning to Strike Iran’s Nuclear Sites,Firstpost,6cwznbP6POI,"And now let us show shift our focus to West Asia , a region embroiled in escalating tensions . A new intelligence obtained by the United States reportedly suggests that Israel is preparing for a possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities , a move that could risk igniting a broader conflict across the region . US officials have reportedly said that Washington has intercepted Israeli communications and observed military activity , including the movement of air munitions and the completion of an air exercise that has raised significant concerns in the Trump administration . While no final decision on a possible strike on Iran has been made yet , US officials allegedly say the likelihood of an Israeli strike has risen in recent months , particularly if a Trump negotiated deal fails to remove Iran 's uranium stockpile . Now , the report about US intelligence has already had a global impact with oil prices jumping over 1 % amid fears of a potential supply disruption in West Asia . And this is n't the first warning . A US intelligence assessment from February had already cautioned that Israel could attempt a strike this year using long range missiles or aircraft to exploit Iran 's degraded air defenses . But even with such tactics , US officials reportedly believe Israel lacks the capability to destroy Iran 's nuclear program without US military support . Yet Tel Aviv has allegedly signaled it may act alone if Washington strikes a deal Israel deems unacceptable . And now those talks remain deadlocked with Washington insisting that Tehran must not enrich uranium , a process that can enable weaponization but is also essential for civilian nuclear power . And according to the International Atomic Energy Agency , Iran now holds nearly 275 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 % close to the 90 % purity level considered weapons grade . Experts say that could be enough if further enriched for up to six nuclear bombs . Tehran maintains its nuclear program is peaceful and reportedly says it will never seek nuclear weapons . But special envoy Steve Woodoff , who is leading the US delegation , said over the weekend that Washington could not allow Iran to have even 1 % of an enrichment capability under an agreement . Have one very clear red line and that is enrichment . We can not allow even 1 % of an enrichment capability . We 've delivered a proposal to the Iranians that we think addresses some of this without disrespecting them . Despite the US submitting the proposal , Iran Supreme Leader Ayatah Ali Kmeni cast doubt on the negotiations on Tuesday . Indirect negotiations existed back then in rece 's time too but there were no results and I do n't think we 'll bring results now who knows we will not allow Iran to enrich uranium is a major overstep no one is waiting for permission for now the next round of talks are expected to take place in Europe this week but with Israel signaling readiness to strike and openly defying demand demands on uranium enrichment . The stakes are rising and the window for diplomacy may be closing faster than expected . At First Post , we are choosing to hold onto accuracy . That means we wo n't always be first .

https://youtu.be/YVn4Od3koA8?si=L3WAczl3_z5iDf2V,Pakistan: Hafiz Saeed's Terror Partner Amir Hamza Reportedly Hospitalised,Firstpost,YVn4Od3koA8,"Global terrorist Hafi sayed 's closest ally and co - founder of the Lashkariba Amir Hamza was reportedly hospitalized not in a regular civilian facility but in a Pakistani military hospital in Lahore under heavy security provided by Pakistan 's intelligence agency the ISI reports say Amir Hamza the 66 - year - old senior Lashkari Tyber terrorist is in critical condition . The exact circumstances remain unknown . On the 20th of May , he was rushed to the military hospital with full ISI security cover , a privilege Islamabad is now openly extending to the listed global terrorists . Known to be an extremist religious preacher , Hamza is a close aid of Lashkari Tyber top terrorist Hafi Sed . A veteran of the Soviet Afghan war , Hamza played a key role in recruiting antis - siet militants through his networks across Iran and present - day Central Asian republics . He edited several Lashkar propaganda publications and was a central figure in radicalizing youth through extremist ideology . The 66 - year - old is also linked to the 2005 terror attack in India 's Bengaluru city . Known for his fiery sermons , Hanza is credited with shaping Lashkari Tibber 's early growth in the 2000s . Scholars say Hanza 's writings label non - Muslims both within and outside Pakistan as , and I quote , legitimate targets of jihad . Hamza was designated a global terrorist in 2012 by the US Treasury Department . But despite that , he made frequent appearances in Pakistani seminaries with fiery speeches asking young terror recruits to wage jihad . The past few days have seen the state of Pakistan come out in brazen support of global terrorists . This includes state funeral for the terrorists killed in India 's operation Synindur in the presence of Pakistani military personnel . Furthermore , Prime Minister Shabbaz Sharif also announced 10 million Pakistani rupees as compensation for each terrorist killed in the Indian missile strikes . And now a certified terror ideologue listed as a global terrorist has been hospitalized in a Pakistani military hospital . That too with Pakistan ISI security cover even for the sake of its once prized political correctness . Pakistan is no longer pretending to hide its support for terror .

https://youtu.be/64WD1wZn90I?si=Tlpl71b6MN1Injp6,Iran-backed Houthis Declare Maritime Blockade on Israel's Largest Port Haifa,Firstpost,64WD1wZn90I,"And finally , we end today looking at a major escalation initiated by the Yemen based Houthi rebels . They 've announced a maritime blockade on Hifa , Israel 's largest port . The facility is a crucial hub for international trade . And according to the Houthis , any ship docked in or heading to Hifa is now legitimate target . In fact , for months , the Iranian proxy has targeted ships in the Red Sea that they claimed were linked to Israel . They say their actions are in response to Israel 's hostilities in Gaza . And now , what does this blockade mean ? And why is this threat much closer to home for Israel ? Our final story has more . Israel 's biggest maritime gateway , the Hifa port , is under threat . The Houthis , a proxy group backed by Iran , have announced a maritime blockade on the facility . They claim any ship docked in or heading to Hifur will be attacked . The Yemeni armed forces relying on Allah and trusting in Allah have decided with Allah 's help to implement the leadership 's directives to begin working to enforce a novel blockade of the port of Ha . Accordingly , all companies with ships present in or heading to this port are hereby notified that as of the time of this announcement , the aforementioned port has been included in the target bank . They are urged to take into consideration the contents of this statement and any subsequent announcements . For months , the Houthis have disrupted global trade . Their attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aiden , which they say are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza , have forced reroutes , delayed cargo , and triggered western retaliation . But why is the development concerning Hifur alarming ? Until now , the Houthi strikes were concentrated in the Red Sea . But Hifer lies on the Mediterranean Sea , far from the Red Sea , which has been the conflict zone . Unlike the Ashtad port , which is close to the Gaza Strip , and has seen repeated rocket threats , Hifur is in Israel 's north and has largely remained insulated from direct attacks . Hifur is also the busiest and Israel 's largest international seap port . Annually about 30 million tons of cargo arrive at the facility . In 2023 alone , Hifer handled roughly 22.1 million metric tons of freight . Israel 's main naval base is also located here . Hifur is a passage connecting Asia , Europe , and West Asia . It has also drawn foreign investment and attention due to its location . In 2023 , India 's largest port operator completed an acquisition of the port in partnership with an Israeli based firm . In March 2025 , Israel 's government gave approval to a Chinese state - owned company to expand operations at Hifas Bayport . Israel largely depends on overseas projects to improve and run its ports . Some 98 % of Israel 's foreign trade passes through seapports . With the announcement of the Hifa blockade , the conflict is now sailing into Israel 's heart of trade and closer to the country 's shores . At first post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy .

https://youtu.be/tBWRQcsd3xc?si=zUQVVvizEG1nD9-9,Venezuela Suspends Colombia Flights Over Threat from Foreign Mercenaries ,Firstpost,tBWRQcsd3xc,"And now moving to South America where tensions are rising fast in Venezuela just days before a crucial election . On Monday , Venezuela 's interior min minister announced the immediate suspension of all flights from neighboring Colombia . The drastic move came after authorities arrested 38 individuals , including 17 foreigners allegedly involved in a plot to destabilize the country ahead of the May 25th parliamentary and gubernatorial elections . According to the when we check flights from Colombia that come from other destinations and enter Venezuela through Colombia , these are flights from Colombia , we have given the instruction to suspend all the flights from Colombia to our country because the information we have is related to this type of movement of people . According to the Venezuelan minister , the detained individuals were carrying explosive devices and planning attacks on sensitive locations such as hospitals , embassies , and police command centers . He claimed that the suspects , a mix of Venezuelans and foreign nationals from countries including Colombia , Mexico , and Ukraine , involved bomb experts , human smugglers , and mercenaries . There are already 38 new mercenaries arrested . The Albanian mafia that governs Ecuador sent part of its trained mercenaries to plant bombs in Venezuela . They have been captured . The Venezuelan Aviation Authority later confirmed that the flight ban would last until May 26 at 6 p.m. local time , a day after the scheduled elections . Colombia 's Minister of Foreign Affairs also stated that Venezuela had informed them flights would resume the day after the vote . Now , addition additionally , the ministry said it had not received any official information regarding the arrest of Colombian nationals boarded and once we were on the plane , they made us get off because an announcement came from Venezuela that they were prohibiting cancelling all flights . The latest development comes amid a tense political atmosphere following Venezuela 's disputed July 28th presidential election . President Nicholas Maduro was declared the winner , but the opposition and several foreign governments have rejected the results , citing credible allegations of electoral fraud . In fact , in a separate televised meeting , President Maduro linked the alleged plot to an Albanian crime group involved in drug trafficking in Ecuador . He claimed this organization was working with Venezuelan opposition forces to disrupt the election process . 38 new mercenaries have been detained . The Albania mafia that governs Ecuador sent some of their trained mercenaries to plant bombs in Venezuela . They have been captured as I have denounced . We have the Albania mafia . We seized three phones from them and they are talking . Tensions have been building in the country as prominent opposition leader Maria Carina Moado has called for a boycott of the upcoming election . In fact , recently five members of her staff who had sought refuge in diplomatic compound for over a year left the country . And while the United States called it a rescue operation , Venezuelan authorities said it was the result of negotiations with Maduro 's government . Dozens of Machado 's allies , including her lawyer and campaign workers , remain imprisoned . Until now , President Gustavo Petro of Colombia , who restored diplomatic relations with Venezuela back in 2022 , has not yet publicly responded . But with both countries walking a tight rope and the elections just days away , one question now looms large over the region . What exactly will happen on May 25th ?

https://youtu.be/0TDbeZxNnvQ?si=wEbH1KnxHOh58kvm,Trump Jokes Putin Likes First Lady Melania More After Ukraine Ceasefire Call,Firstpost,0TDbeZxNnvQ,"We begin with the developments coming in from the war in Europe . President Donald Trump has spoken to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine 's Lord Menzalinski on Monday . After his nearly 2 and a half hour phone call with President Putin , the president said Russia and Ukraine would immediately begin negotiations towards a ceasefire . The president described the conversation as a breakthrough as he looks to push for an elusive deal to end the conflict that has promised that he promised on the campaign trail to resolve within 24 hours . Spent two and a half hours talking to Vladimir Putin and I think some progress has been made . It 's a terrible situation going on over there . 5,000 young people every single week are being killed . So hopefully we did something . However , Russian President Putin struck a more measured tone , saying he is now ready to work with Keefe on a memorandum outlining a possible peace agreement , but insisted compromises will be required on both sides . He also thanked President Trump for supporting the resumption of direct talks between Moscow and Keev . We agreed with the US president that Russia will suggest and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace treaty which defines a number of issues such as the principles of settlement , the terms of a possible peace agreement and so on , including a possible ceasefire for a certain period of time if the appropriate agreements are reached . Now , as Moscow signaled cautious openness to negotiations , attention quickly shifted to Keefe , where President Zalinsky held his own discussions with President Trump both before and after the call with President Putin . Zalinsky , who has in fact patched up relations with the US president after a contentious meeting in the Oval Office office , urged Trump to not make any decisions without Ukraine . He later said Keev and its partners might seek a high level meeting among Ukraine , Russia , the United States , European Union countries , and Britain as part of a push to end the war . President Trump , we are considering a meeting of all teams again . We would it to be at a high level , America , Ukraine , Russia , European countries , and Great Britain . Such meeting could take place in Turkey , Vatican or Switzerland . Meanwhile , President Trump later said that Pope Leo had expressed interest in hosting negotiations at the Vatican . The idea has found widespread attraction and appreciation from leaders across the world , including both Italy and Germany . Be great to have it at the Vatican . Maybe it would have some extra significance . There 's tremendous bitterness , anger , and I think maybe that could help some of that anger . So having it at the Vatican would be in Rome would be a very I think it would be a great idea . And the Kremlin has also welcomed the offer at the Vatican , but said no final decision has been made on where talks might take place . It 's also noted that no specific time frame for a ceasefire was discussed during the call between the two leaders . Furthermore , away from the diplomatic front , President Trump also made headlines at the White House event where he revealed that President Putin expressed admiration for First Lady Melania Trump . President Trump jokingly stated that Moscow unquote respected and liked the first lady more than him . He made these comments while speaking at a White House ceremony where he signed the Take It Down Act , an initial an initiative led by the first lady aimed at combating deep fake pornography . is blessed to have such a dedicated and compassionate first lady , I would tell you she is very dedicated . , in fact , , if you look at just what I heard , Putin just said , "" They respect your wife a lot . "" I said , "" What about me ? "" , they will . They they Melania better . That was n't good . I do n't know if that was good . I 'm with it . But despite this lighter moment , the talks are still in their very early stages . And with major differences still unresolved , the path to peace for Ukraine remains highly uncertain .

https://youtu.be/rBkC8Bi5zfI?si=aybLR32gINczAac3,Trump Administration Wins Supreme Court Order to Remove TPS for Venezuelan,Firstpost,rBkC8Bi5zfI,"And now we shift our attention to a significant development here in Washington . The US Supreme Court has cleared the way for President Donald Trump 's administration to end legal protections that have sheltered nearly 350,000 Venezuelans from deportation . In a ruling issued on Monday , the court allowed the Department of Homeland Security to terminate temporary protected status or TPS that was granted by President Trump 's predecessor Joe Biden . TPS allows nationals from countries facing war , disaster , or extraordinary conditions to live and work legally in the United States . While the design designation is meant to be short - term , many protections have been extended for decades without a pathway to citizenship . In fact , days before leaving office , President Biden extended TPS for Venezuelans by 18 months , citing the ongoing crisis under President Nicholas Maduro . But the new administration is taking a different course . President Trump has vowed to deport record numbers of migrants in the country illegally and his secretary of homeland security has already moved to end TPS for Venezuelans , Haitians , Afghans , and Cameroonians . Mission of the Department of Homeland Security is to secure our nation and to make sure that we 're out there going after those that are the worst of the worst , the criminals , the bad actors . And as part of the immigration crackdown , the Trump administration has also invoked a wartime law to fasttrack the deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members and has deployed troops to the southern border to deter illegal crossings . And in a first under a new program called Project Homecoming , the US on Monday deported a group of undocumented migrants who chose to return voluntarily . A total of 64 migrants boarded a flight from Houston to Honduras and Colombia , each receiving a $ 1,000 stipen to leave the country legally with the option to apply for re - entry in the future . Take control of your departure and receive financial support to return home . If you do n't , you will be subjected to fines , arrest , deportation , and will never be allowed to return . And now 38 migrants arrived in San Pedro Sulo in Honduras where officials say many expressed fear over growing hostility in the United States including fears of going to work due to raids in restaurants and other workplaces . Honduran officials further confirmed that among the returnees were 19 children including four born in the United States . aid their reintegration .

https://youtu.be/ETGvYHSZQVA?si=n3IE3R9AoKqSUVyb,Is COVID Making a Comeback? Asia Sees Surge in Cases,Firstpost,ETGvYHSZQVA,"Is the Wuhan virus back ? In recent weeks , several Asian countries have reported a surge in cases . This mainly includes Thailand , Singapore , and Hong Kong . They have reported tens of thousands of cases in recent days . Many people have lost their lives . Now , governments are speeding up vaccinations and urging vigilance . What about India ? Cases have seen a moderate rise in India as well . So should you be worried ? What is behind this uptick of Wuhan virus cases in Asia ? And three years after the pandemic , where does the global preparedness level stands ? Here 's a report . The pandemic pushed the world indoors . Between 2020 and 2022 , it killed millions of people . But is it making a comeback now ? In Hong Kong , a new wave has begun . Infection rate has jumped from 1.7 % in mid - March to 11.4 % . In just the week ending May 3rd , 81 severe cases were reported with 31 deaths . This is a 1 - year high for the country . Cases are surging in Thailand as well . Last week , more than 33,000 cases were reported with at least 6,000 from Bangkok alone . The total has more than doubled from the week before . Meanwhile , Singapore is witnessing its first major spike in a year . More than 14,000 cases were reported in the week ending May 3rd , up from the week before . So why are cases rising again ? Experts attribute the Wuhan virus resurgence to a range of factors waning immunity , fewer booster shots and increased vulnerability among high - risisk groups the elderly and unvaccinated children . Experts say that there are no dangerous new variants . The cases have been attributed to strains descending from the JN1 variant . This was first found in August 2023 . JN1 has about 30 mutations . The most common ones are being found in the recent cases and experts say that the current variants are not more severe or contagious than earlier ones . So while there is cause for concern , but no need to panic . After all , the Wuhan virus is not going away . It is evolving , making its return every now and then . So as health authorities are urging vigilance , governments are speeding up vaccinations . What about India ? Cases have seen a slight uptick in recent days . Currently , there are at least 257 active cases . The highest number of cases come from the state of Kerala followed by Maharashtra where two deaths have been reported and Tamil Nadu . India is closely monitoring the situation . After all , preparedness is key and the world has made some progress in this area . After three years of negotations , countries have adopted the pandemic agreement . They signed off at an annual meeting of the World Health Organization . This is only the second time in the WH 's history that an international agreement has been reached . The first was the tobacco control deal in 2003 . Of course , the US is not part of this agreement , having withdrawn from the WHO after Donald Trump took office . This may dim the treaty 's success , but this legally binding accord is a positive step . It requires countries to take steps to prevent , prepare for , and respond to pandemics with rapid sharing of data on new diseases and improved accessibility of vaccines , masks , and other crucial supplies across the globe . And for the first time , the WHO itself will have an overview of this . While execution on the ground could be another battle altogether , this accord comes at a crucial time as Wuhan virus persists and evolves . It is a tangible example of strengthening prevention , international collaboration , and taking lessons from the pandemic that changed the world as we knew it .

https://youtu.be/jUGbm6Ym3R4?si=HdliB6XLPTpEroXC,Elon Musk’s X Under Fire: Terror Groups Found Paying for Blue Ticks?,Firstpost,jUGbm6Ym3R4,"Now , let 's talk about ex Elon Musk 's social media app . Specifically , the story is about the blue tick . It was once considered a symbol of elite status and a badge of credibility . Today , it risks becoming a tool for verified extremism . This is a shocking claim made by an American watchdog . Their report says that X is has been taking money from terrorists including those terrorists who are sanctioned by the US government . It focuses on accounts linked to terrorist organizations . They 're paying for X premium and in exchange they 're getting the verified badge . Terrorists are getting the verified badge and enhanced visibility . These findings are serious . They raise several legal and security questions . So is X now a platform for terrorists ? Is it amplifying terrorists ? Our next report explores . When Elon Musk bought Twitter , one of the first moves he made was against the blue tick . The app that 's now called X started selling them . So instead of an elite group , everyone can now get verified for a price , including terrorists . , that 's the claim made by a US - based watchdog . It found that accounts belonging to terrorists are paying for premium access . Their report looked into X Premium , earlier known as Twitter Blue . Alongside profile verification , paid users get a host of other features . Users are promised higher visibility . Their posts are boosted as well . The report identified accounts tied to an al - Qaeda adviser , a member of the Hezbollah , the leader of an Iraqi militia that targeted US troops , and a senior Houthi official . There are over 200 suspect accounts in all . They are either connected to known terror groups or entities under American sanctions . One of the names on this list is Subhit Dufaili . He 's a founding member of the Hezbollah . He 's been under US sanctions since 1995 and he has a verified ex account . It has been active since October last year . It has over 40,000 followers and this account regularly posts fulllength sermon videos and it 's paying for premium access . This could have severe legal implications for Musk . Under United States law , no company can engage in financial transactions with sanctioned individuals or groups . If X has accepted payments from these accounts knowingly or not , it may have breached US laws . And there 's more at stake than just compliance . The verified status could be misused to be promoting hateful propaganda . This would seriously undermine counterterrorism efforts , all under the banner of free speech . X 's own policy states that sanctioned users can not access premium features , but this study claims they are still able to pay and get verified . This raises serious questions . Who is vetting these subscribers ? What checks , if any , are being run ? And how are sanctioned terrorists able to pay an American company ? Musk promised to level the field . Instead , he 's opened the gates to bad actors , to sanctioned entities , and to those who exploit algorithms to amplify violence . The blue tick was once a mark of trust . Today , it 's quickly becoming a liability . At first Post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy . That means we wo n't always be first . We may not get you your breaking alert , but what you will get is what we owe you . And that is the truth . Verified , checked , and cross - cheed . We rely on sources and verified ones .

https://youtu.be/MyX-kuIRJAk?si=9OAFGoOf5UulcOCZ,TikTok Under Fire as Nigerian Terrorists Use App for Propaganda,Firstpost,MyX-kuIRJAk,"The extremist 's playbook in Nigeria just got an upgrade and this time it comes with Wi - Fi , ring lights and Tik Tok filters in what security experts are calling a digital propaganda makeover . Extremists in northeastern Nigeria , including terrorists of Boka Haram , are turning to Tik Tok to broadcast their violent ideology , recruit young followers and to show off their AK-47s its influencer content . In April alone , over 100 people were killed in extremist attacks in Boro State . It is the epicenter of Nigeria 's 15 - year long insurgency . But while bullets were flying offline , extremists were busy going live on Tik Tok . But what is their content ? It 's a mashup of anti - western rants , calls to arms , nostalgic clips of Boo Haram 's founder because apparently extremists enjoy a hashtag throwback Thursday . The vibe is worryingly reminiscent of the early days of Boo Haram 's rise under its now deceased leader Abu Bako Sakao . Now except this time it comes with Tik Tok 's digital gifts feature which can be turned into actual money . , people are tipping jihadists on Tik Tok . Bulama Bukarti of Bridgeway Foundation , which is dedicated to ending and preventing mass atrocities around the world , says that it started with bandits and now the jihadists are hosting full - on Tik Tok shows , preaching violence and threatening critics . Bukati himself was targeted in a now deleted video . And while Tik Tok says it 's actively removing extremist content , many accounts are still being operated in plain sight . 19 of them reportedly feature men in clerical garb opening openly calling for violence and some even teaming up with other influencers in joint live streams . Collab culture at its most sinister . Security analysts say that this is n't accidental . Boo Haram and its more social media savvy rival , the Islamic State West Africa province know where to find the next generation online . Experts say they 're reaching the youth by speaking their language . Looks they have ditched the dull speeches and are going straight for verality . And it 's reportedly working . Now , these digital extremists are connecting with viewers , answering questions , and receiving real - time support , both emotional and financial . Meanwhile , their barefaced live streams send another message . They are not hiding . Experts say they want people to know they are real , bold , and unafraid . Tik Tok , for its part , insists it 's not a haven for extremism . The platform says it works with global partners to detect and remove violent content and continues to enforce its zero tolerance policy . But critics point out that many harmful accounts remain live and moderation has n't kept up with the innovation of extremists . One thing is clear , the battlefield has moved from forests of Boro to the 4U page of Tik Tok . At first post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy . That means we wo n't always be first .

https://youtu.be/VaAbojq974Q?si=O4nqTqOCwzWjre4K,Reports Say Trump Planning to Relocate Gazans to Libya; US Embassy Denies,Firstpost,VaAbojq974Q,"Shifting focus to Libya , which according to some reports is Trump 's new target destination for relocating Gazins . Now , US media is reporting that the Trump administration is planning to permanently relocate up to 1 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Libya . The report citing US officials claim the plan is under serious consideration with discussions already taking place with Libya 's leadership . In exchange for resettling Palestinians , Washington may release billions of dollars to Libya in frozen funds that have been blocked in the US for over a decade . However , for now , the US has denied these reports . The US embassy in Libya has called the reports false . Libya 's UN recognized government of national unity has also refused to relocate gardens . Now , this is not the first time an African country has been mentioned as a possible destination for displaced gazins . Earlier this year , President Trump said that he wanted the United States to take control of the Gaza Strip and to resettle its Palestinian population elsewhere . The idea faced strong opposition and global backlash . When Trump first floated this idea after taking office , he suggested that US allies Egypt and Jordan could take in Gaza 's population . Both countries rejected the idea , which was widely condemned by Palestinians , Arab states , and the United Nations as an act of ethnic cleansing . In April , Trump stated that Palestinians could be moved around to different countries , adding that plenty of countries would accept them . Since then , the names of Morocco , Sudan , and the disputed Somali territories of Somaliand and Puntland have surfaced as possible options . All of them have publicly denied any involvement or interest . Now , Trump has again reaffirmed his desire to take over Gaza . During a visit to Qatar this week , he declared that Gaza should become a freedom zone and claimed there was nothing left to save . We 're working very hard on Gaza and Gaza 's been a territory of death and destruction for many years . And , I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good . Make it a freedom zone . Let the United States get involved . and make it just a freedom zone . Have a real freedom zone because it seems that Gaza every time , , every 10 years it happens and more than that . Trump 's proposals have been widely criticized on legal , ethical , and humanitarian grounds . And similar concerns have been raised about the Libya plan . Libya , still deeply divided and unstable , has been torn between rival administrations since 2014 . one UN recognized , the other military - led . Additionally , reports indicate that the Trump administration has been planning to deport undocumented migrants to Libya . This is a move recently blocked by a US federal judge . While Trump continues to reaffirm his intent to take control of the war torn strip , so far his relocation plan has failed to gain traction or find willing partners .

https://youtu.be/DlJX3RSyszs?si=6PfaNPNyfH-RZCfO,ICJ Rules in Favor of Equatorial Guinea's Dispute Over Oil-Rich Islands with Gabon,Firstpost,DlJX3RSyszs,"And now we shift focus to West Africa . A longunning territorial dispute between neighbors Equatorial Guinea and Gaban has reached a climax and the final verdict has sided with Equatorial Guinea . Now , the International Court of Justice , the highest judicial body of the United Nations , has ruled in favor of Equatorial Guinea in a decadesl long dispute with Gaban . The two nations have been squabbbling for decades over three small islands in the oil richch Gulf of Guinea . Now , these include the island of two smaller low - lying eyelets , Cockatier and Conga . They cover just up to 30 hectares and are virtually uninhabited . But the discovery of oil on the islands pitted the neighbors against each other . Both nations began asserting sovereignity over the once insignificant islands . Gaban 's forces expelled Equatorial Guiney 's military from the islands and established a presence . Yet the dispute never escalated into an armed conflict . Instead , both countries chose a diplomatic path . In 2016 , they signed a special agreement to submit the matter to the ICJ . They promised to accept its ruling , whatever the outcome . After years of deliberation , the ICJ has now issued its final and binding verdict . Now , the court has ruled that Equatorial Guiney 's claim based on the 1900 Paris Treaty dividing French and Spanish colonial territories is legally valid . The court rejected Gaban 's main argument that a later treaty , the 1974 BA Convention , had transferred the islands to Gaban . While the ICJ has resolved multiple territorial disputes before , this case stands out . Unlike many cases brought to the court due to high tensions or armed conflicts , Gaban and Equatorial Guinea approached the court voluntarily and collaborative collaboratively . Now , their aim was to find a peaceful and friendly resolution , not to win a political fight . This is also one of the rare AfricanAfrican territorial cases taken to the ICJ . Most similar cases involve countries from different continents or disputes involving major global powers and few international cases involve such small uninhabited islands though rich in strategic value . The case showcases a rare commitment to peaceful legal resolution on the African continent . Both countries trusted the ICJ 's authority and demonstrated a mutual faith in international law . This legally binding mechanism , choosing law over force , is still uncommon in many regional disputes . Could this model set a new standard for how African nations and others resolve territorial tensions in the future ? At First Post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy .

https://youtu.be/dFQ8Hw8divg?si=wk5qFhZnqfJWSVcS,Philippines: Marcos Open To Reconciling With Dutertes Before Impeachment Showdown,Firstpost,dFQ8Hw8divg,"We shift our focus to the Philippines . President Ferdinand Marcus Jr. has offered an olive branch to his ally turned rival , Vice President Sarah Duterte . A week after Vice President Duterte 's allies outperformed expectations in the midterm elections , President Marcus Jr. said that he was open to reconciling with the Duterte family . The reconcilement offer comes weeks before Vice President Sarah Duterte 's impeachment trial in the Senate and months after her bitter fallout with the president 's camp . President Marcus said that he does not want trouble and wants everyone to get along . He added he needs friends , not enemies . In an indirect reference to the accusations of corruption against Vice President Sarah Duterte , the Filipino president asked her to do the job and do not mess around anymore . When President was asked if he stands against Sarah Duterte 's Senate impeachment trial , he said that the impeachment is now with the Senate and the process must be allowed to take its course . Vice President Sarah Duterte is yet to respond to these remarks , but in her earlier comments , she said that she wants her impeachment trial to go ahead . Addressing the reporters after the midterm election results last weekend , Vice President Duterte said , and I quote , "" I truly want a trial because I want a bloodbath . "" unquote . The continued rift between the Marcus and the Duterte families , once touted as a powerful uni team in the 2022 presidential elections , is fast unraveling . Vice President Sarah Duterte resigned as education secretary in the Marcus government in June of 2024 . In November , Vice President Duterte publicly declared that her relationship with President Marcus had reached a point of no return , accusing his camp of harassment and conspiring to remove her from office . In February of this year , Duterte was impeached by the House of Representatives on several charges , including graft and corruption . The ties further plummeted in March of this year when the Marcus administration cooperated with Interpol to facilitate the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte . The political relationship between President Marcus and Vice President Duterte will now be tested in the Senate impeachment trial which the Duterte camp expects to survive . As the impeachment trial approaches , the once formidable Marcus Duterte uni team now stands divided . With President Marco calling for peace and Vice President Duterte welcoming a bloodbath in the Senate , the looming showdown could redefine power dynamics in the Philippines .

Intensifying its crackdown on illegal immigration in the country . The Trump administration has announced steps to impose visa restrictions on Indian travel agencies . The curbs would apply to the owners , executives , and senior officials of travel agencies that knowingly facilitate illegal immigration to the United States . The US State Department said that the American Embassy in India and its consulates were working actively to identify those aiding illegal migration , human smuggling and trafficking operations . It also warned of further steps to cut off alleged alien smuggling networks . Now , these curves would also apply to the people who qualify for the visa waiver program , which enables individuals to travel to the United States for tourism or business for 90 days or less without obtaining a visa . The State Department stated that the American immigration policy aims to inform nationals and hold the violators accountable . The US did not specify the number or the people who would face these restrictions . The American embassy said that the details of the targeted individuals or the agencies can not be shared due to visa record confidentiality . Now the announcement came months after the US deported illegal Indian immigrants . The Trump administration repatriated around 300 individuals to India in February while some 50 Indians were reportedly sent to Panama . Now the reported handcuffing and shackling of the deported women and children sparked massive backlash forcing the Indian side to take up the matter with the US authorities . The Indian government also said that it opposes illegal immigration and that it is ready to take back all its citizens in the US who are there without proper documentation . The Indian external affairs ministry also said that it is ready to work with the Trump administration to address all matters related to illegal immigration and to facilitate the return of all such migrants . Now , according to reports , the immigration issue was also discussed during US Vice President JD Vance 's India visit last month . The US visa curves came at a time when there is a sharp rise in Indians attempting to reach the US through illegal routes . Last year alone , the US authorities detained over 96,000 Indian nationals at the Mexico border . Many of these were victims of the travel agents who make misleading promises and lure them into taking perilous journeys to the US in exchange for a hefty amount . The Indian authorities have also issued advisories against such fraudulent . The latest US visa curbs are in sync with Indian government 's advisory . It not only aims to deter illegal immigrants but also targets its facilitators . At First Post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy . That means we wo n't always be first .

https://youtu.be/9vhROAtZ0Xg?si=f13NrGr-HOkvVbad,Trump's DHS Mulls Citizenship Competition Show For Illegal Immigrants,Firstpost,9vhROAtZ0Xg,"Today we begin in the US where President Trump 's sweeping crackdown on immigration meets the glitz of reality television . In a surprising twist , the Department of Homeland Security is currently considering a pitch for a reality television show in which immigrants compete through a series of American themed challenges to earn US citizenship . The pitch submitted by Canadian - American television producer Rob Warsoft was confirmed by DHS officials on Friday . Trisha Mccclaclin , assistant secretary for public affairs , described the proposal as a unquote celebration of being an American and emphasized the agency 's willingness to review out the box pitches . However , she did clarify that the idea is still under review and has neither been approved nor rejected . The pitch generally was a celebration of being an American and what a privilege it is to be able to be a citizen of the United States of America . It 's important to revive civic duty . Now , Woroff , who 's best known for his work on Duck Dynasty , a reality television show about a Louisiana hunting family popular among Trump supporters , said the inspiration for this new concept be came from his own naturalization experience . We need a national conversation about what it means to be American . We need to be reminded of how proud and what an honor it is to be American . Now , the show , which remains untitled , will feature one - hour episodes where contestants who will be all immigrants would face a range of physical , mental , and cultural challenges rooted in American traditions . In fact , according to a 36 - page pitch deck , exa accessed by the Daily Mail , the show would open with immigrants arriving at Ellis Island , the historic entry point for millions of newcomers to the United States . Then the competitors would travel across iconic American locations . And according to the pitch , one challenge might take place at NASA facilities in Texas or Florida , where contestants would be tasked with assembling and launching a rocket . And in another , participants would be asked to reenact the California Gold Rush in San Francisco , testing who can retrieve the most precious metal from a mine . And in the meantime , there would also be elimination challenges where contestants get divided into two groups . And although finale would the finale would feature the winner being sworn in as a US citizen , but more importantly , Warso did emphasize that there would be no deportation or legal consequences for participants who in fact lose . This is n't the Hunger Games for immigrants . This is not , "" , if you lose , we are shipping you out on a boat out of the country . The proposal comes at a time when immigration remains a highly charged issue . And President Donald Trump himself , a former reality television show host , has pushed aggressive policies through DHS targeting undocumented immigrants , refugees , and even some legal residents . In fact , his administration has also worked to eliminate temporary protected status for nationals from countries Haiti , Venezuela , and Afghanistan . So , as DHS reviews the pitch , the question remains , will America really turn the path to citizenship into a national game show ?

https://youtu.be/R5AlMcArxmw?si=M5k6i-8hKp6QPQtc,Former US President Joe Biden Diagnosed with Aggressive Prostate Cancer ,Firstpost,R5AlMcArxmw,"Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that 's already spread to his bones . The diagnosis comes just months after he left office and stepped away from a second presidential run due to mounting health concerns . Biden , who lost his son Bo to brain cancer in 2015 , has led major efforts to combat the disease nationally . And as the former president and his family reviewed treatment options , support has poured in from across the political aisle . including from President Trump . Here 's the story with more . Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has already spread to his bones . The 82year - old was seen by doctors last week after experiencing urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule was discovered . Following further tests , his office confirmed the diagnosis on Friday . Last week , President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms . On Friday , he was diagnosed with prostate cancer characterized by a Gleason score of nine with metastasis to the bone . While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease , the cancer appears to be hormone sensitive , which allows for effective management . Now , in a rare moment of political unity , President Donald Trump , who is Biden 's longtime political rival , responded with sympathy , writing on his platform , Truth Social , Trump said , "" We are saddened to hear about Joe Biden 's diagnosis . We extend our warmest wishes to Jill and the family . We wish Joe a fast and successful recovery . "" Vice President Kamala Harris , who took over as a Democratic nominee after Biden dropped out of the 2024 election race , also expressed heartfelt concern . Joe is a fighter , she wrote on X. He will face this challenge with the same strength , resilience , and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership . Former President Barack Obama shared his support in a moving message . Michelle and I are thinking of the entire Biden family . He wrote , "" Nobody has done more to advance cancer research than Joe . We pray for a fast and full recovery . Joe Biden 's battle with cancer is deeply personal . In 2015 , he lost his eldest son , Bo Biden , to brain cancer . Bo 's death had a profound impact on him and became a driving force behind his mission to fight the disease . "" Following the tragedy , cancer research became one of Biden 's most important causes . In 2016 , then President Barack Obama appointed Joe Biden to lead the Cancer Moonshot Initiative , a nationwide effort to accelerate cancer breakthroughs . Then as president , Joe Biden relaunched the initiative in 2022 with the goal of having cancer deaths by 2047 . Millions of dollars in funding and national tension followed , driven by Biden 's passion and leadership . His efforts gave hope to countless families across the country . And now that same disease presents him with a personal battle unlike any other . Biden 's diagnosis comes just months after he left office . He had dropped out the 2024 election race following a widely criticized debate performance and growing concerns about his health . Kamala Harris stepped in as the Democratic nominee but ultimately lost to Donald Trump . Throughout his long career , Joe Biden has faced immense loss and personal hardship . From losing his wife and daughter in a tragic car crash in 1972 to surviving a brain aneurysm in 1988 to burying his beloved son , his life has been defined by resilience . And as he faces another test , people close to him believe he will meet it with the same quiet strength he has shown for decades . As former President Bill Clinton said , Joe Biden has always been a fighter . This battle will be no different . At First Post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy .

Special agent Jonathan Buma has alleged that Russia 's intelligence agency , the GRU , targeted Elon Musk by exploiting the billionaire 's alleged weakness for sex , drugs , and a lavish lifestyle . Now , according to reports , the operation involved attempts to influence tech CEOs to gather compromising information allegedly approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself . Musk 's susceptibility to promiscuous women and drug use , especially ketamine , were seen by Russian intelligence , as an opportunity for an agent to exploit . The former FBI agent claims that Musk 's liking for the desert rave event Burning Man , adult entertainment , and gambling were seen by Russian security agents as a possible access point to the tech billionaire . Moreover , the alleged operation extended to venture capitalist and PayPal founder Peter Teal . The GRU known for its aggressive and clandestine global operations is one of the most powerful arms of Russia 's intelligence agency . It envoys from the agency allegedly offered both Musk and Teal direct contact with President Putin . The invoice sent to contact Musk and feel offered direct contact with Putin . they would not have done so if Putin had not personally known about the action and approved it . Now , reports suggest that Elon Musk has been in direct contact with Putin since at least 2022 with discussions ranging from personal matters to geopolitical issues . In fact , one alleged request by the Russian leader was for Musk to not activate a Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan as a favor to Chinese President and Putin ally Xi Jinping . Meanwhile , the Tesla and SpaceX CEO stance on Ukraine has also evolved over time . In 2022 , he reportedly offered his Starling satellite service free to the Ukrainian armed forces , but later threatened to pull back the support . And by last year , he 'd become increasingly critical of Keefe as he aligned himself with US President Donald Trump . Now , earlier this year , Musk suggested that Ukraine must hold elections , claiming that President Vimmer Zalinski would lose . However , the claims of the Russian intelligence agency targeting Elon Musk emerged as the tech billionaire 's popularity and business profits have declined amid his involvement in the Trump administration . Now , last month , Musk signaled that he would be stepping back from his role as a chair of Doge to fully focus on his company Tesla . Despite this , President Trump said that the tech billionaire could stay in the administration for as long as he wanted . Really been a tremendous help . you opened up a lot of eyes as to what could be done and we just want to thank you very much and you 're invited to stay as long as you want . So with Russia spy agency accused of targeting tech billionaires the focus now shift to just how deep does the influence go and what it means for US security in the years to come .

https://youtu.be/SM7pePpKJ0c?si=qpcXx2Y1JtSrTsue,Kenya's Former Justice Minister Martha Karua Deported From Tanzania,Firstpost,SM7pePpKJ0c,"And shifting focus to the East African nation of Tanzania from where Kenyan lawyer and presidential candidate Martha Kurua has been deported . Now Kurua was in Tanzania to defend opposition leader Tundu Lissu facing treason charges . The vocal critic of the alleged backsliding democracy in Eastern Africa , Kurua said that she was stopped at the Dar Salam airport with her group and was then put on a flight out the same day . She also posted a video of her waiting at the airport , saying that she was awaiting deportation after retrieving bags . The Kenyan leader lashed out at the Tanzanian government for her expulsion . Now , the former justice minister said that her deportation was a sign that Tanzanian authorities would not give a fair trial to Chadma party leader Lissu . She accused President Samu , her son 's party , of subverting the law to lock up the main contenders ahead of the October election . Alura 's People 's Liberation Party or the PLP said that she was subjected to hours of unwarranted interrogation before her deportation . This as the Tanzanian opposition leader was due to face a trial today . Now he can not seek bail as he faces treason charges for which the maximum punishment is a death sentence . Tindulisu was arrested last month for holding a rally with the slogan no reforms no election . He seeks sweeping changes in the electoral system claiming that the current laws do not allow free and fair elections . His Chadma party has been barred from contesting the upcoming polls as it refused to sign a code of conduct . Chadma sees the document as a ploy to contain the opposition . But Lizu is not the only opposition leader of a neighboring country who Kurua has been representing . She represents Ugandan leader Kiz as well . Now he also faces treason charges . The former military officer was kidnapped in Kenya last year and taken back to his home country for a trial . Uganda will hold elections in January . The country 's president Jeri Mussi 's son , the Ugandan army chief , General Mahuzi Kanyuga has threatened voters . In a stern warning , he asked non - suporters to be very careful , adding that traitors would be deported in public view . Kua has condemned such abductions , arbitrary arrests , and extrajudicial killings as she fights for political victims in East African nations . She is preparing to run for the 2027 Kenya presidential election and formed her own party in February of this year to fight in the polls . She faces competition from several opposition leaders , all of whom are hoping to take on President William RTO . At First Post , we are choosing to hold onto accuracy .

https://youtu.be/-kFARcCmVRI?si=azlpH9cE-R_mNupr,US Eyes Ivory Coast for Drone Base to Solidify Ties With West Africa,Firstpost,-kFARcCmVRI,"And now shifting focus to West Africa where the United States is significantly bolstering its military partnership with the Ivory Coast as a part of a strategic recalibration of its presence in West Africa . Now this development comes in the wake of the US military withdrawal from Nijair and amidst growing instability across the Sahul region . Reports suggest that discussions are underway for the potential establishment of a US drone base in Ivory Coast 's Abjan city . With its growing collaboration with the US , Ivory Coast is poised to play an increasingly vital role in countering jihadist threats , maritime piracy , and crossber smuggling across the Sahal and the Gulf of Guinea . Now the instability in neighboring countries Mali , Bkina Faso and Nijair has also prompted the US to solidify its ties with West Africa . This deepening partnership between United States and Ivory Coast also carries geopolitical weight . It is being seen as a part of Washington 's broader strategy to counterbalance the increasing influence of Moscow and Beijing in the region . On the 24th of April , the US Marine Corps General Michael Langley , who is the commander of the US Africa Command , Africa , visited the Ivory Coast , and he attended the opening ceremony of Flint Block 2025 , which is the command 's annual multinational special operations exercise held in Jacavville . During his visit , General Langley along with the US ambassador Jessica Davis held crucial meetings with the Ivorian Minister of Defense Tene Bimma Qatara and the Chief of Defense Staff , Lieutenant General Lina Dumbia . Now , discussions centered on strengthening bilateral cooperation to effectively address transnational threats with a clear emphasis on Ivory Coast 's expanding role as a leader in regional security . Talks also included the potential establishment of a US drone base within the Ivory Coast . While no final decision on constructing a permanent base has been made , high level consultations are actively ongoing regarding the expansion of US operations . While earlier reports suggested planning of a base near ODN , Afric 's West Africa coordinator Kenneth Ecman clarified last year that no specific location has been finalized . However , he did indicate that regions near the borders with Mali and Bkina Faso are under serious consideration due to the elevated threat from jihadist groups operating in those areas . Now , the evening military partnership between the US and the Ivory Coast marks a significant shift in Washington 's approach to security in West Africa . The potential establishment of a US drone base underscores the growing importance of Ivory Coast as a key player in a complex and evolving regional security landscape .

https://youtu.be/iQTFGMJM0l4?si=MDwTk9wIcovYhlsU,Libyan Protesters Demand Prime Minister Quit After Armed Clashes,Firstpost,iQTFGMJM0l4,"And shifting focus to Libya where deadly clashes and escalating militia violence have triggered widespread calls for prime minister to resign . Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Tripoli over the weekend . They gathered at Martr Square before marching to the premier 's office demanding that Prime Minister Abdul Hamemed Baba resignation . Now , the government confirmed one security officer was killed while guarding the premises . Down with the government . Down with a government of collaborators . The government of normalization . With God 's help , we will not leave the square and will continue the civil disobedience until the Bible falls . This demonstration is to denounce the situation we are in , which my country and its citizens are suffering from . Repression , wars , and a lack of respect for the Libyan citizen . The situation is no longer bearable enough . The protests have also divided the government . At least three ministers have resigned in solidarity and several municipal councils in western Libya are also backing the call for Deba to step down . Now , the unrest follows days of violent clashes between rival armed groups , leaving at least eight dead , including the notorious militia leader Abdul Gani Kitley . Fighting continued despite a ceasefire announcement . Now , the clashes involved pro and anti - government militias . However , progovernment groups seem to have gained an upper hand , signaling a possible power shift that may strengthen Deba 's grip on Tripoli . Over the weekend , Bea met with tribal leaders in his first public appearance since the violence erupted last week . He urged them to support state efforts to avoid a return to chaos and militia rule . We will welcome all those who choose to stand with the state . We will sideline those who resort to blackmail and corruption . Our goal is a Libya free of militias and corruption . militias had grown excessively to the point of controlling the entire political , financial , economic , and even social landscape . Libya has been in turmoil since the 2011 NATO backed uprising that ousted the dictator Moar Gaddafi . Since 2014 , it has been split with General Khalifa Haftar controlling the east and the UN recognized government of national unity led by Deba based in the west . Under a UNbacked road map , Libya was supposed to hold elections in 2021 , but the vote was postponed and Deabber has remained in power . Tripoli remains deeply fractured with militias vying for control across the capital . As the situation remains tense , Turkey , a key ally of DEA , has evacuated 82 citizens . The United Nations continues to raise alarms over Libya 's fragile stability . So , political uncertainty continues to loom large over Libya . Pressure on Prime Minister Deba is mounting with ministers quitting and militias rearming . The road to stability remains uncertain . At first post , we are choosing to hold onto accuracy .

https://youtu.be/afoZwpYNuvI?si=MFjoTnURmC4vgotF,"US Accuses Sudan of Using Chemical Weapons in War, Imposes Sanctions",Firstpost,afoZwpYNuvI,"Moving on to the war in Sudan . The United States has made some shocking accusations . The US says Sudan 's military used chemical weapons last year in its civil war against the paramilitary rapid support forces or the RSF . And for that , Washington is now slapping sanctions on cartoon . The US state department issued a statement . It says that Sudan must stop using chemical weapons and stick to its promises under an international treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention . A treaty that almost every country has signed , promising not to use these kinds of weapons . Washington said it 's committed to punishing those who spread or use chemical weapons . However , the US has not clarified exactly when or where the weapons were used , but some reports earlier stated that Sudan 's army used chemical weapons at least twice in its battle against the paramilitary group , the RSF . The report said that the chemical used was likely chlorine gas , which can cause severe breathing issues and even death . Yesterday , the US formally informed Congress about its findings . This now kicks off a 15 - day clock after which new sanctions will come into effect . Those sanctions will block American exports and financial support to Sudan 's armybacked government . But the impact might be small . That 's because both Sudan 's army chief Abdul Fatal Alrahan and his rival RSF commander Muhammad Han Dalo are already under US sanctions . The war between the two forces broke out in April of 2023 and it has ripped the country apart . Tens of thousands of lives have been lost . At least 13 million people have been forced to flee from their homes . And the United Nations calls it the world 's largest displacement crisis . Now just this week , the army claimed that it had pushed the RSF out of their final positions near the capital Kartum . We announced today the complete clearance of the entire cartoon state from any presence of members of the terrorist militia of Dagalo and the clearance of our national capital from the filth of the rebels and their supporters stressing that cartoon state is completely free of rebels . After nearly two months of intense fighting , Sudan 's army says it has now retaken full control of cartoon state . But the bigger question remains , even if the battlefield changes , will the human cost ever be reversed ? At First Post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy .

https://youtu.be/NVjJrnww0XI?si=kMbdEbpT9P3A9M2-,Chinese Coast Guard Fires Water Cannons at Philippine Vessel in South China Sea,Firstpost,NVjJrnww0XI,"Let 's turn our attention to the tensions flaring in the South China Sea . China and the Philippines have yet again traded strong accusations following a confrontation between their vessels in the contested waters . The Philippine Coast Guard has released a drone footage of an incident that took place on Wednesday . The footage shows the Chinese Coast Guard vessel firing water cannons and side sweeping one of the vessels belonging to the Philippines Fisheries Bureau . Now , the incident reportedly occurred as the Philippine ships were conducting marine research near a disputed reef . Another video filmed from on board the Philippine vessel showed that the Chinese vessel was moving in and colliding with it while the crew frantically spoke to their Chinese counterparts on the radio . The Philippines Fisheries Bureau said that the lives of the civilian crew were put at risk during the incident . Philippines has condemned what it called the aggressive interference by the Chinese Coast Guard . Manila also stated that their vessels had not previously been subjected to such actions in this area . However , Beijing has offered a starkly different account . The Chinese Coast Guard asserts that the two Philippine vessels illegally entered waters near the Sui Reef and Sandy Ki and that personnel were organized to land on Sandy Ki . Beijing claims that its response involved professional and lawful control measures , including going ashore to verify the situation . The Chinese statement further alleges that a collision occurred after a Philippine vessel ignored multiple warnings and dangerously approached a Chinese vessel . The Chinese statement made no mention of the use of water cannons . And in the latest move , Chinese foreign ministry has urged the Philippines to immediately stop infringement and provocation in the South China Sea or face China 's resolute response . Beijing also said that it was legitimate for China to take necessary measures and the US should not use the Philippines to stir up trouble in the region . Now , the US ambassador to Manila , Mary Kay Carlson , has strongly criticized China 's actions , describing them as aggressive and stating that they recklessly endangered lives and threatened regional stability . Sandy Ki , the location mentioned in both accounts , is situated close to the T2 Islands . Now , this island is the largest and the most strategically significant of the nine features in the Spratley Archipelago currently occupied by the Philippines . It 's a region where China along with Malaysia , Taiwan , and Vietnam also maintain a presence further complicating these territorial claims . Now , this latest confrontation follows China 's statement last month that its coast guard had landed on Sandy Ki as part of operations to assert its sovereignity . However , Manila has refuted any claims that Beijing has seized control of the disputed reef . China lays claim to nearly the entire South China Sea . While a 2016 International Arbitial Tribunal ruling has dismissed Beijing 's sweeping claims under international law , China has consistently rejected this decision and this latest exchange of accusations highlights the persistent tensions and the potential for escalation in the South China Sea .

https://youtu.be/a8PSS9UIwoU?si=Kof1Z1p6jrc6DWTC,Bangladesh: Army Demands Election As Yunus Defers And Threatens To Resign,Firstpost,a8PSS9UIwoU,"In Bangladesh , the power struggle between the caretaker government and the military seems to have exploded into full public view . The flash point , a fixed date for national elections or the lack of one . The country 's army chief says that elections must be held by December this year , if not sooner . General Waka U Zaman , the chief of the army staff of Bangladesh in his most blistering critique yet of the interim government led by Muhammad Eunis , Bangladesh army chief has said that the country is passing through a chaotic phase and that the situation is worsening with each passing day . The army chief added that the structure of the civil administration and law enforcement agencies has collapsed and failed to reconstitute . Hours after that stinging statement , rumors swirled in Bangladeshi media . Is Muhammad Ununice about to resign ? Later on the evening of 22nd of May , UNUNICE held critical talks with the country 's new political faces , student leaders who spearheaded last year 's protests against the then Prime Minister Shik Hassina . After the meeting , student leader Nah Islam told media that Ununice is indeed considering stepping down . Now , Ununice reportedly questioned whether he could continue under the current political climate . Earlier today , an aid to Muhammad Ununice said in a Facebook post that the country 's chief adviser will not resign . The UNUNICE aid also warned the army against interfering in politics and said the army of no civilized country engages in politics . The aid further added that nobody can hijack UNICE 's authority . That Facebook post was later deleted . Now the rift between UNUNICE and the military has now become a full - blown standoff fueled by his everchanging timeline for the national elections . Bangladesh has been under an interim government since August of 2024 after Shay Casino resigned and fled to India . In October of 2024 , a UNUNICE aid said that the election in Bangladesh will be held by mid 2025 . And later in December , interim leader Ununice himself pushed them further , saying that the elections are possible only in early 2026 . Now , the Bangladesh army chief has said that the elections must be held by December of 2025 or even before that . Now , the UNUNIS government claims it needs more time to reform a broken system and to update voter polls . But 9 months in , patience is wearing thin . This month , ailing former Prime Minister Khaled Zia returned to Dhaka and her party , the BMP , immediately amplified demands for swift elections . Then another flash point , the UNUNIS government banned the ousted prime minister Sha Cassena 's Awami League party , triggering diplomatic push back from New Delhi over shrinking democratic space . And on the Awami League without due process is a concerning development . As a democracy , India is naturally concerned at containment of democratic freedoms and shrinking political space . We strongly support the early holding of free , fair and inclusive elections in Bangladesh . Bangladesh now stands at a crucial crossroads . While interim leader Ununice argues that electoral and administrative reforms are essential before any vote can be held , the military , opposition parties , and the rest of population are demanding a clear and timely road map to restore democratic order .

They may be small , but they 're mighty and they 're in trouble . From the farms of Europe in the countryside to the urban gardens , the world 's bees and pollinators are facing a silent crisis . War , pollution , climate change , and even well - intended environmental policies are threatening the very species we rely on for our food and ecosystems . Our final report looks at the troubling trend . A report by Bee Wild issued a sobering wakeup call about bees . Those tiny tileless pollinators that we rely on for everything from apples to almonds are now under siege from a growing swarm of global threats , including war zones , pollution , and even climate change efforts . Researchers have identified 12 emerging dangers to bees and other pollinators that could spell disaster over the next decade if left unchecked . These include war and conflict , microlastic particles , artificial light , antibiotic pollution , air pollution , pesticide cocktails , and frequent wildfires . Let 's take a look . On top of the list is war and conflict . The report names Russia 's invasion of Ukraine and other global conflicts as major disruptors of biodiversity . Farmers in wateron regions are being forced to stop crop rotation and rely heavily on monoculture farming . This is bad news for pollinators who need a variety of flowers throughout the year to survive . Add in heavy metal pollution from bombs and shelling . Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zalinski are at the center of this it seems . Researchers also found microplastics contaminating hundreds of bee colonies across Europe . They also found that synthetic particles are showing up in honeycombs . Meanwhile , air pollution , artificial light , and even antibiotics are taking their toll on bees ability to forage , pollinate , and survive . Even our green efforts to combat climate change are proving to be a mixed bag for bees . The European Union 's goal of planting 3 billion trees by 2030 might help absorb carbon , but without careful planning , this could also reduce biodiversity and starve pollinators of food . Likewise , the mining of rare metals for electric vehicle batteries is bulldozing natural habitats at an alarming rate . Thankfully , it 's all not doom and gloom . The report also highlights a dozen solutions to save the bees . These include planting pollinator friendly flowers in urban gardens or creating bee havens in solar parks . The report also had some tech ideas using AI to track pollinator health or developing pesticides that target the pests without harming the bees . There 's also a push to breed crops with more nutritious pollen and nectar and to introduce stronger laws to curb antibiotic and pesticide use . Pollinators bees , butterflies , birds , and bats are responsible for helping 90 % of flowering plants and 75 % of staple crops thrive . Their survival is directly tied to ours from our diets to our climate and also to our economic . So the next time you swat away a bee , remember it may be the most important worker you never paid .

The company is at a critical juncture as it navigates a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence and a trade war . Apple 's dominant position in the tech industry is facing a threat and a recent development is expected to put more pressure on the tech giant . It is the deal between OpenAI led by Sam Ultman and former iPhone designer Johnny Ives startup IO products . In a significant move , OpenAI is acquiring IV 's startup for a staggering $ 6.5 billion . Now , Johnny played an instrumental role in shaping the iconic look of the iPhone and other Apple products . He will now oversee design at OpenAI , including their foray into new hardware devices . This means a key architect of Apple 's past success is now aligned with a leading force in AI . Love from the design firm founded by IV after leaving Apple has been working with Open AI for 2 years on generative AI devices . With IV leading design , OpenAI aims to pair the technology behind its popular chatbot chat GPT with the product design expertise that made devices such as the iPhone best sellers . Iv and Ultman have indicated their initial devices wo n't directly compete with smartphones . However , the broader tech landscape is on the cusp of significant change . Even Apple acknowledges the shift . In testimony during the US government 's antitrust case against Google , Apple services chief Eddie Q admitted the challenges incumbents face with new technologies . He even pointed to Apple 's own history , highlighting how the iPhone itself disrupted the once dominant iPod . The question now is whether Apple is prepared to disrupt itself before a competitor does . Along with trying to keep pace with technological revolution powered by AI , Apple is also navigating geopolitical headwinds . Recent reports indicate a strained relationship between the CEO Tim Cook and US President Donald Trump . Trump has threatened to impose 25 % tariffs on iPhones made outside the US . He 's not pleased with Apple 's plan to make the devices in India rather than domestically . If this tariff takes effect in June as planned , iPhone prices are bound to increase . Ultimately , the message is clear . In the fast - paced world of technology , nothing is guaranteed . Apple 's past success provides no immunity to future disruption . The coming months and years will be critical in determining whether Apple can adapt , innovate , and secure its position at the forefront of the next technological revolution . [ Music ]"

https://youtu.be/HxB729gUNV0?si=OnzeD8YI5gEAfe6k,What Is the Carbon Footprint of Artificial Intelligence?,Firstpost,HxB729gUNV0,"Our next story is about the carbon footprint of artificial intelligence . AI is transforming the way we live and work . From writing emails to advancing scientific research . But behind the convenience and innovation lies a growing environmental cost . In the next report , we take a closer look at the carbon and water footprint of generative AI and what our digital future might mean for the planet . Step aside , cow farts and long haul flights . There 's a new eco villain in town . And it answers to the name of artificial intelligence . That 's . Your favorite chatty chatbot may be revolutionizing work , creativity , and science , but they 're also racking up a carbon footprint that 's so large it could wear a size 57 boot . Generative AI is the darling of Silicon Valley . But behind that helpful tone and dazzling output lies a ravenous energy monster gobbling up electricity . Training models of AI do n't just take smarts but megaww . In 2021 , according to reports , the training of Chat GPT used enough energy to power 120 average US homes for an entire year . And it does n't stop there . Every time we casually ask Chat GPT to summarize an article , generate a poem or a dating app bio , it sucks down about five times more electricity than a simple Google search . So , your AIBF is not just helpful , it 's also thirsty for power . But wait , it 's not just electricity that this tech giant is guzzling . AI has a water problem , too . A big one . Keeping those overheated server stacks cool requires a staggering amount of chilled water . Training a large model GPT3 can chug nearly 700,000 L of fresh water . Data centers , the physical homes for all this AI brain power , are multiplying rabbits on an energy drink binge . Companies are racing to build more , often powered by not so green fossil fuels . Each data center can house approximately 50,000 power hungry servers . In 2021 globally , they consumed 460 terowatt hours of electricity , putting them on par with entire countries France and Saudi Arabia . By 2026 , they are projected to soar to 1,50 terowatt hours , outranking even Japan . Who knew your email summary came with the carbon footprint of a G7 economy ? And let 's talk hardware , a graphics processing unit , the muscle behind AI 's genius , are guzzlers in their own way . Manufacturing these higherformance chips , takes more power than an average CPU , not to mention the dirty business of mining the rare earth materials needed to build them . In 2023 alone , data centers reportedly received 3.85 million GPUs , up from 2.67 million the year before . The worst part , these AI models age faster than avocados . Companies roll out newer , bigger , and more energy guzzling models every few weeks , making previous ones obsolete , hence wasting all that training energy in the process . Yet here we are , still enchanted by AI 's siren song . With sleep interfaces , magical outputs , and zero visible emissions , it 's easy to forget the environmental beast behind the curtain . So , the next time you 're about to ask your favorite AI to write your email , generate a dinner recipe , or plan your best friend 's birthday , take a pause . Maybe give Mother Earth a break . Because while AI may be writing the future , it 's also quietly roasting the planet one chat at a time . At first Post , we are choosing to hold on to accuracy .

https://youtu.be/qzGcfneKdI8?si=keO7YrE8dCLpuKg4,Ukraine: Germany says allies scrap range limits on arms to Kyiv ,France 24 English,qzGcfneKdI8,"Ukraine says that Russian forces have captured four villages in its Sumi region not far from the border , an area just opposite Russia 's Kursk region . In fact , that comes as Russia continues to escalate its bombing campaign across Ukraine . Germany 's chancellor said that European leaders have told KE they 're lifting the limits on the range of the missiles they 're giving to Keefe , effectively allowing Ukraine to strike positions across in Russia . Let 's cross live to Kev to get the latest on that from our correspondent there , Emanuel Shaz . Emanuel , tell us more . What does this announcement from Germany change for Ukraine ? , Ukraine was already striking deep into Russian territory , but with its own weapons and within limitations when it comes to the use of Western weapons . Remember last November , then US President Joe Biden had lifted restrictions of on the use of long range American missiles , but within a certain range . So along the Russian border on a 300 kilometers parameters parameter and in fact Ukraine needs to strike deeper if it wants to target military infrastructure within Russian territory and it did so with its own weapon but it always called for its allies to also allow it to use western weapons for those targets as well . So this announcement from freedish merits is of course welcomed here in Kev . But just in back in November when Mizenski had said that missiles would talk for themselves . There was no comment from the Ukrainian president on that use . Has it already happened ? Will it happen soon ? of course for strategic reasons is not going to be discussed but it should be welcomed by the Ukrainian military so that they can increase the strikes and the force of the strikes that are launched on Russian military infrastructures . That means that they can target further and perhaps more efficiently depending which missiles they will use on ammunition they pose on warehouses on production sites for missiles and ammunition . so this will this will come as a welcome news for Ukraine under intense pressure and under intense Russian bombing as of the last few days . Indeed , Emanuel , that campaign by Russia intensifying sharply recently . It did . Over the weekend , we 've had over 900 drones , dozens of missiles which were thrown at Ukraine by Russia . There 's at least 20 people who died , civilians who died . There 's at least 80 people who were injured , missiles , drones , debris of both falling on houses . While Russia continues to say that it targets only military infrastructure and there again German Chancellor Fred says that the authorization now given to Kiev to strike with long range western weapons deep within Russian territory has been made because at the to the contrary of what Russia is doing , Ukraine solely targets military infrastructure and this comes at a time of intense pressure not just from Russian bombing But also , you 've mentioned it also on the front line in the border region of Sunumi , which is under a constant Russian fire . There are now four Ukrainian settlements in the Sunumi region that Ukraine says are now occupied by Russia . They used to be in what we call the gray zone . So , not undefined presence whether it 's is held by Ukrainian or Russian troops . And now it has been confirmed that Russians have made advances there entering again this territory at the border and it 's just across this co region where the Ukrainian army had started operations back in August 2024 . Shazin , thanks very much for bringing us that update ."
https://youtu.be/Ml-QkkWJAvo?si=uLkNGFuX2vEsWbDM,Two years since Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Act became law,France 24 English,Ml-QkkWJAvo,"It 's been 2 years since Uganda passed one of the world 's harshest anti - gay laws and Human Rights Watch is now reporting that since it came into force . Authorities in the country have committed widespread discrimination and violence against lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people . The 69page long report also accuses the government of deliberately trying to negatively shape public discourse about LGBTQ people in Uganda in the leadup to the antihomosexuality act being signed into law into 20 in 2023 . We 're joined now by Omo who is a senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch . OM thank you so much for joining us on the program . So , of course , we know that being gay in Uganda was already very difficult before this law came into force . Tell us what it 's to be gay or transgender now . , so historically , samesex acts have been criminalized in Uganda for many years . It 's been the result of legislation that was passed by the British colonial powers . But what has happened since is that the Ugandan government has entrenched homophobia . They 've legitimized it by passing this law in 2023 . , and they 've made it such that people living in Uganda who may identify as LGBT or not live in fear of criminal persecution , but also of their communities attacking them because they think they may or may not be gay . So , it 's really just a climate of fear that people are living in Uganda . And this report accuses authorities of using social media and dating apps , for example , to target LGBTQ people . Tell us more about that . So what we found when we talked to people in Uganda was that they are being they 've they 've been they 've met people online who they think may potentially be people that they want to talk to or explore relationships with but turn out to be police officers in some cases who are trying to extort them who end up extorting them at the threat of arresting them because of this law that criminalizes homosexuality . They tell them that , "" , we will take you to the police station if you do n't give us a certain amount of money . "" And it 's it 's really the result of the law . So , the law does n't make it legal for people to be extorted . But because there 's a law that says that if you 're gay , you could be criminalized , a lot of people , including government officials , police officers , feel that they can get away with committing those kinds of acts against LGBT people . And let 's talk more about this law because I 've said it 's one of the harshest anti - gay laws in the world . Tell us what it really calls for exactly . So the first crime that it creates is the crime of homosexuality . It is a crime to an offense to commit homosexuality which is samesex acts if a man has sex with a man or a woman has sex with a woman . But then there 's also other sub crimes . is if you have sex with somebody with disability for example of the same sex or somebody who is of advanced age some of those criminal those offenses now in addition to a jail sentence could land you a death sentence which is what makes the law really terrible . nobody should be sentenced to death because of a consensual same - sex act . , but there 's also other really vague and very problematic provisions . One of which is this notion of promoting homosexuality . And this is where people who are LGBT allies , people who work with NOS 's that provide services to LGBT people can potentially be face reprisals because if somebody accuses you of promoting homosexuality , whatever that means , it 's very vaguely described in the law . then you could also be sent to prison . And just finally , what 's your message to the government ? , , first of all , the government should n't be legislating hate against anyone u based on their sexuality or any other characteristics . So , they need to do away with this law . That 's what we 're calling on the government and the parliament specifically to remove this law . But in the meantime , there needs to be a climate of acceptance and non - discrimination against all people . Nobody should be discriminated against based on their sexuality and the authorities really need to promote equality in that respect and so that 's what we would really to see . , we should mention that Human Rights Watch did contact the government to comment on the report , but they did n't respond . OM , thank you so much for joining us on the program . Really great to get your insights on what is a very important topic ."

It 's a place where caregivers listen and provide support until the very last breath , but also an area of healthcare where dignity can be restored through the smallest of gestures painting one 's nails . I want to be beautiful from head to toe . When I look at myself in the mirror , I see an image of myself that is n't sick . That makes me feel good . She 's been battling cancer for 22 years and has had four recurrences . This is her second stay at this paliotative care facility . [ Music ] We 're pampered . I did n't know that existed . I 'm going to hand out angels in blue gowns and in purple gowns . A few days after filming this , Fatia passed away at 69 . Paliative medicine is designed to take care of people . But above all , its aim is to do everything to ease suffering . Jacqu Lera also has incurable cancer . Faced with unbearable pain , he asked to die . Continuous sedation until death is the only legal option today . His medical team proposed a treatment plan instead . The pain has gone from and gone from 8 to zero . I 'm not in pain anymore . Does that mean without pain you 're willing to go further in your illness ? , [ Music ] Jack is taking a break , as he puts it . He 's gone back home and returns to the hospital for weekly consultations . But for the former doctor , an assisted dying law is necessary . [ Music ] How are you today ? Today very well . We Jacqueline Palmier arrived at this paliative care unit a few days ago . No treatment can cure her . I asked myself if I were feeling better , if I were in less pain , would I want to continue ? The answer is no . For me , it 's . So I asked myself because it 's scary to die after all . It 's called freedom of choice . To stop . The proposed law would allow for a patient to administer a lethal substance to themselves or request a doctor or nurse to do so . Jacqueline asks her doctor what she would do . [ Music ] How would you react to this request if it were possible ? , but you 're the one who 's sick . , of course , I 'll be with you . For a doctor , helping someone die is not natural . , it 's taboo . Does that mean for you helping someone die can be a part of care ? , it can be part of care . Of course , for this woman , I want nothing more than what she wants , if it 's possible , and if it 's within the law . It 's also something I might want if I were in the same situation . This hospital in Paris has 25 beds for end of life care . Once a week , a doctor , nurse , physiootherapist , and psychologist assess each patient together . The pain is easing a little but it 's still there for them . The future law must include this type of decision making amongst a team of paliotative care professionals . Another aspect that must be in place is putting in safeguards . In Belgium , the to die has been extended to minors and psychiatric patients . What aspects defined in the proposed law do you find unsatisfactory ? We can clearly see the problems in Belgium . Ultimately , the limits are constantly being questioned and pushed back . So for me , that 's the aspect that scares me . In this department , a dozen or so sick patients request to die each year . What will the future look with this new law ? And what are the potential consequences ? How will I react as a human ? I do n't know . I do n't know anything . We have to live with it . We 're caregivers . We 're human beings . We 're talking about humanity here . I do n't want this to be a debate between paliotative care and medical support for dying . It 's not either or . It 's not an eitheror choice . Both can exist . These caregivers hope for a peaceful debate on the to assisted death . They say they trust legislators to pass a heavily regulated law that would be a benefit to all ."

And Brian , we 're going to start well here in the European Union where leaders are pushing Brussels to reach a trade deal with the United States . Indeed . so the EU currently has until July 9th to make a deal with the Trump administration . Last Friday , the president threatened to slap 50 % tariffs on European goods on June 1st before extending that deadline after a call with EU Commission President Ursula Vanderlion . Over the weekend , Trump had accused Brussels of slow walking trade talks after the US was forced to deescalate its trade war with China due to threats of a supply shock in the states . Italy , France , Ireland , and Spain are all reportedly urging Brussels to instead fasttrack those talks . Now , if implemented , Trump 's 50 % tariffs would target some 321 billion euros in EU goods . He 's already put 10 % tariffs on all global imports to the US as well as 25 % duties on European steel and aluminum . Europe has prepared a package of retaliatory levies on $ 21 billion of American imports in response to the metals tariffs with an additional list of $ 95 billion in US goods should Trump follow through on that 50 % threat . That trade conflict could shave 6/10en of a percent off US GDP and help fuel inflation there . Analysts though say it would likely be even worse for Europe . The EU would to deescalate . If there 's a compromise that can be found that would take the tension out of the system , that would just pull everyone back from the from the brink and get rid of some of this uncertainty . That 's something Brussels would very much . If it does go into allout trade war , Brussels will have to retaliate . And that 's something that will take a lot of time , a lot of energy , and have a lot of cost to the real economy . , in the midst of this increasingly uncertain global trade environment , leaders in Asia and the Middle East looking to shore up their trade ties . Indeed , they are the 46th Azan Summit of Southeast Asian nations currently underway in Kua Lumpur , Malaysia . This year , the gathering is taking on added urgency as Trump 's global trade war threatens the region 's heavily export - driven economies . In a bit to insulate those economies , Azan is holding its first ever trilateral talks with China with Premier Lee Kyang there as well as the Gulf Cooperation Council of Middle Eastern oil producing countries . The US remains Southeast Asia 's largest source of foreign investment with China coming in fourth place after Japan and the EU Trump 's tariffs though changing the outlook there . Meanwhile , with China as Washington 's prime target for tariffs , Beijing is looking to boost its exports to non- US countries . China and Azan are already each other 's largest trading partners . With Chinese exports to Thailand , Vietnam , and Indonesia up by double digits in April , China says it wants to boost cooperation with Azan as much as possible . Take a listen here . collaboration will also foster the use of common technology to promote integrated digital economy . meanwhile the closer cooperation will lead to their increasing interaction across business sectors which will promote trade and investment flows and reliable and resilient supply chains in the region . Let 's get a quick check in on the today 's trading action . How are the markets shaping up so far ? So , it 's a mixed picture on Asian indexes Tuesday as investors try to keep up with that constantly changing global trade context . Concerns over mounting US debt . Meanwhile , as Republicans try to push Trump 's budget busting big , beautiful bill through the Senate are pushing the dollar down against Asian currencies . That is bad news for Japanese exporters , but the Nikk in Tokyo still managing to gain around half a percent . Meanwhile , a second straight month of growing industrial profits in China not enough to keep Hong Kong and Shanghai out of the red . The Cosby in Seoul giving up some ground after hitting a three - month high on Monday . It is off by half a percent just ahead of the closing bell there . And finally , Ryan , from you for this hour here in France , we 're seeing a recent spade of crypto crime finally resulting in some arrests . So , Eve , usually when we talk about crypto crime , it 's either about hacking digital wallets , online scams , that thing . France though has seen a number of violent kidnappings as gangs have sought to extort ransoms from people who have made fortunes in cryptocurrencies . Around 15 people were arrested on Monday morning . Jennishin and her colleagues at France have the details . At the Paris police headquarters on Monday afternoon , unmarked trucks and around 30 men from the anti - bandit squad mobilized for a large - scale raid . After three weeks of investigation , some 15 people have been arrested in Paris and its suburbs , as well as the Lisa region in western France . They 're suspected of taking part in this violent kidnapping attempt on May 13th in broad daylight in the heart of Paris . [ Applause ] A young woman whose father made a fortune in cryptocurrency narrowly escaped thanks to the help of passers by . Investigators say this case is linked to another kidnapping in Paris just 13 days prior . The father of a cryptocurrency millionaire was mutilated here in the Paris suburbs for three days . His finger cut off by attackers before he was released by the police . We 're seeing the same recruitment method we 're currently seeing in many cases with a very young workforce recruited on social media . So far , the suspects include two miners and two young delinquents known to authorities for common crimes who are believed to have been in charge of the logistics and the vehicles used for the kidnappings . But they 're only a small part of a much larger crime underworld that now targets cryptocurrency fortunes . It 's much better for an individual to rob someone who has a wallet with a few bitcoins than to rob a bank . That amount quickly exceeds hundreds of thousands of dollars and it 's less risky . An investigation is now underway to identify the masterminds . Always a risky asset , crisp currencies , but you would hope that risk would stay in the financial realm and not the physical one . Eve , indeed . Brian Quinn , thanks a lot for that business update ."

Spain , an outspoken critic of the war in Gaza , urging EU partners to follow its lead and stop selling weapons to Israel . , let 's cross to Madrid . We 're going to talk to our correspondent , Sarah Morris , who joins us from there now . Sarah , Spain really trying to influence , if you , other EU countries to rethink their policies amid the war in Gaza . That 's . The foreign minister , Jose Manuel Alvarez , said the time for talking was over and it was time to take action against Israel because of that inhumane attack and renewed attack on Gaza . and he said that they would be calling on the EU allies for the immediate suspension of that EU cooperation deal with Israel . But also there should be no sale of arms to or from Israel . And he said that was a stance that Spain had maintained already since the invasion of Gaza . he also talked about individual sanctions being imposed on West Bank settlers who are violent . there are already sanctions imposed by the EU and Spain , but he said they should be extended and essentially he was speaking after that conference that he had organized and hosted in Madrid on Sunday in which he persuaded Arab leaders to meet with members of the EU of for instance France , German , Germany and Italy and said that more and more of his EU new allies are in favor of what he 's advocating for . And it 's not the first time , is it Sarah , that Spain has pushed for further action on Israel . It certainly is n't , sir . Stuart , because last year Spain led the way for a number of countries in the European Union to recognize Palestinia on the basis of those borders prior to the 1967 war . He was joined by Ireland for instance and we 've even seen recently that there has been a diplomatic spat with Israel over the Eurovvision entry because the Israeli singer Yuval Raphael with her song New Day Will Rise . She came second , but she came first in the Spanish public vote . And Spain and the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has said that they would an audit of the counting system and they also want Israel to be banned . Pedro Sanchez , the socialist prime minister , said that it was double standards that Israel was allowed into that competition because Russia had been banned after its invasion in Ukraine . and he said that sent a bad message very tense relations between Israel and Spain even though the foreign minister Albertis insists that his stance is not against Israel that this is paving the way for peace in the Middle East and he says that allies must hang on to the idea of a viable two - state solution .

https://youtu.be/mykcb8giWCY?si=popNltkCFlc9g5Tz,"What is the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the organization whose head resigned?",France 24 English,mykcb8giWCY,"Now , as well with our international affairs editor , Philip Tur . Philip , let 's talk about the aid first of all , as we did with Noga , this resignation as well yesterday of Jake Wood , the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation . what on earth 's going on here ? . . , the first point here I think it 's should be really underlined is that this is a private company . This is not a bonafide humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders or the World Food Program for example . this is an organization that has a base in Delaware in the United States . It was only created back in February this year . and as you were just saying , the executive director Jake Wood resigned the day before yesterday in a surprise decision because he 's not in agreement with the way that this humanitarian foundation humanitarian foundation is being organized . He 's been replaced by a man called John Akri who has been well known in the United States for organizing disaster relief particularly during flooding for example . but there is a lot of suspicion about the aims of this organization . The fact that it was created by the United States and has the backing of Israel . What is it going to do ? How is it going to set the humanitarian organization up as we 're just hearing from Noga ? Nothing appears to be happening now . he 's not even bringing any aid in to the Gaza Strip . But what they 're planning to do is to set up four different areas within the Gaza Strip where that aid is bought in . Which means that all of those who require it will have to walk long distances to collect that aid and it will be given to them in boxes which weigh about 20 km 20 kilos each . and that means that those people who are injured , who are frail , who are children will not probably be able to carry those boxes back . And it will also endanger them going to these distribution centers because they have to walk there and if they 're injured for example they wo n't be able to do that . So it just remains to be seen how this aid is going to be handed out . Now there are also claims and a lot of suspicion behind the scenes about the ultimate goal of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation . That 's to say that it 's not really set up to operate a normal humanitarian organization . What it wants to do is to feed civilians who can get to the distribution centers , these four centers in central southern Gaza and then not hand out any food to any person who is suspected of being a member of Hamas or who is known to be a member of Hamas . That 's to say to starve Hamas out to weaken them so that they will then have to surrender . So it 's not being used as a humanitarian organization but as an arm of war or a war weapon to try to weaken Hamas further . And therefore it 's not being created with an objective decisionmaking body but more or less under the offices and under the desires of the Israeli government . What about all that confusion there that Nogle was talking about to do with his claims of the ceasefire Palestinian claims of a new ceasefire agreement in the pipeline ? How might it work ? , that also , , as we just were hearing , , looks incredibly unlikely now because there 's a lot of , as they 'd say in French , cacophony coming out or , , different , , points of view and no agreement . So , first of all , it 's a 70 - day ceasefire . , it would end up with the release of 10 living Israeli hostages . that 's to say five who were released straight away at the start of the ceasefire and then another five when the ceasefire was due to come to an end after 70 days and there would also be a partial Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip . No news from Benjamin Netanyahu as to whether or not the government would be ready to accept this . That 's the first point . And then all this confusion between Hamas and the United States and Israel over whether or not they they had accepted it or they had n't accepted it . It was supposedly based on a plan put forward by the US envoy Steve Wickoff . U but the US has said in fact it 's not based on a plan put forward by Steve Wickoff . A Hamas source on Monday said we are willing to accept this proposal . And then another statement afterwards said that we 're not willing to accept it . Israel has said that it is not willing to accept it . That was a report today on AFP , the French newswire , quoting a an anonymous Israeli government source , saying , , this ceasefire proposal can not be accepted by any responsible government . , it does not match one put forward by the US special envoy , Steve Witov . So , , what we 're seeing is no advance , , on any ceasefire deal , no hope of any ceasefire deal in the coming days , and certainly no positive remarks coming out from , , the prime minister of Israel , Benjamin Netanyahu . Phil , thanks very much . Philip 's going to stay with us to talk about Europe in a"
https://youtu.be/kAsV6qGC4-Q?si=JaLyinF4iLLrS-uz,New aid system in Gaza begins operations after more than two months of blockade ,France 24 English,kAsV6qGC4-Q,"So slowly but surely , little by little , some aid is beginning to be distributed into Gaza . The US and Israelback foundation , given the task of supplying it , it says it has now begun operations . It says that truckloads of food have already made it to distribution points and some has already been handed out . There 's little evidence of that though . There 's no confirmation , for example , from the Palestinian side . But the foundation says moves will step up over the coming days . The distribution coming as the foundation 's executive director , you may remember we told you yesterday , resigned because he said that operation could not fulfill its mission in a way that adhered to humanitarian principles . , let 's find out more then . We 're going to cross to Jerusalem , talk to our correspondent , Nogatanapski , who joins us from there . And , it 's still very unclear what may have got through , but it is pretty clear , is n't it ? This is still very much a drop in the ocean , even if some aid is getting there . , it 's barely a drop in the ocean . To my understanding , maybe one or 200 truckloads of food have been able to enter Gaza since the end of last week after more than two months of a blockade . I 'm not sure that very much of it at all has gotten to its destination either to the warehouses or to individuals who they we know that a few bakeries received enough flour to begin making bread but it really is very poultry . , I wanted to add to the best of my current understanding , this foundation that you mentioned , the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that lost its CEO on the day it was supposed to begin work two days ago . I do n't it 's not my understanding that they are yet being able to process any aid at all . I think it 's still Israel manning the borders and the UN bringing in its trucks . this old - fashioned system that is very haltingly beginning to bring in some aid and that the foundation has not yet been able to establish any regular mechanism for the distribution of aid at all . Meanwhile , Naga Benamin Netanyahu 's been speaking , pledging to bring hostages home and amid little known news as it stands on those plans for a 70 - day ceasefire that would see 10 Israeli hostages released . Let 's set hear from him . As in the past , so to today . We will defeat those who seek to take our lives . We will bring back all our hostages and we will ensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel . So , Naga , still no real update then on this potential peace plan . Nothing but confusion and a lot of pain . Yesterday , Prime Minister Netanyahu released in the evening a casual video statement he has begun doing in recent days in which he said , "" I hope to have news , good news about releasing the hostages today , maybe tomorrow . "" This not only triggered headlines around the world , but it triggered hope among the very confused families of hostage . We 're talking about almost 60 families in Israel whose loved ones , alive and dead , are still being held by Hamas in Gaza . And it took about 20 or 30 minutes until Prime Minister Netanyahu 's office released the humiliating statement that he had just been using a turn of phrase , a figure of speech that of course he did n't really mean today or tomorrow . It was just his way of saying that we will always try and get the hostages out . This ended up causing rage in Israel . Absolute rage across the board . And another bit of confusion was caused by the fact that it appears that two Trump envoys Bishara Bakbach , the former head of Arabameans for Trump , who had a hand in the release of the Israeli American hostage , Idan Alexander , and the envoy for everything , Steve Witkov , who is supposed to be in charge of trying to end this Gaza war , that they had each proposed somewhat different proposals . Bakbach to Hamas , Witkov to Israel . And that was the reason for such confused statements yesterday . Hamas saying we had accepted , then they 're saying , we have n't . The Israelis saying we rejected and we accepted . All of this mess apparently stems from some behind - the - scenes negotiations that are still taking place by these two gentlemen who are not yet completely coordinated and offers they 're making each side . , thanks very much .

https://youtu.be/E0QLniiZhbY?si=qwm8K1zMtNPMHDFr,Horsing around': Macron brushes off video showing wife shoving him in the face,France 24 English,E0QLniiZhbY,"[ Music ] Vic Bahal is here in studio . Verica , we mentioned Emanuel Macron 's visit to Vietnam there in the business news . Now , a viral video has been making headlines around the world today . Breit Macron allegedly pushing her husband . What do we know about that video and what 's been the official reaction ? , Sharon , it 's the viral moment between the Macrons that has threatened to overshadow a huge day for the French president , his visit to Vietnam . Now , I think we 've all seen the video by now , but for anyone at home who has n't , let 's take one more look through . , the video starts with the French president about to exit his plane that 's just landed in Hanoi when a hand comes out in a red jacket and pushes his face , appears to shove his face . And this red jacket we learn later in the video belongs to his wife Brit who then joins him in coming down from the aircraft . Now this is the third time this month that the French president has been subject to disinformation swirling about him or false narratives that the Elise palace has been correcting left and center particularly claims that have been shared on pro - Russian accounts . , and according to French media and the French press in general , , that is exactly what happened with this video as well . Apparently , the Elise Palace , quick denounced it as fake , , suggesting that there was AI or Russian interference involved . But then they did a U - turn when the Associated Press , who filmed that video , published it in full . So , this is what the Elise Palace said after that . They said it was a moment where the president and his wife were decompressing one last time before the start of the trip by horsing around . Now , President Mron has also spoken about the incident as well . He said to the press , weighing in directly , he denied that there was any type of violence involved . He said , "" My wife and I were squabbbling , joking rather , and I was taken by surprise . "" He then redirected the focus to Russian disinformation and extremism in France . So Sharon , that is the official chronology , the official timeline of these statements and that 's everything that we know about it so far . , that is the official version of events . Then what has the reaction been though online ? , as we just saw , the French president tried to pull the focus back to Russian disinformation campaign . and Moscow in return has now taken some shots back at the French president . So this is the telegram account of Maria Zakarova . She is the press officer for the Kremlin . and she was very quick to fuel many of those previous stories that have come out over this month about that have pushed Macron into a disinformation storm . So she has shared many of those and now she 's commented on this video as well . She says the world has seen footage of Macron receiving a hook from his wife . and then she says what 's interesting is not this but what the Elise Palace will come up with this time . And she finishes with a pretty forceful line saying here saying let me give you a hint maybe it was the hand of the Kremlin . So very direct shots there taken by the press officer of the Kremlin . Now in terms of the reactions in France and online I think it 's safe to say that there has been a negative surge in reactions towards Breijit and many of them either negative towards Breijit or mocking Macron . We can see a few of them here on X. This is just a smattering of the many posts that I saw saying that Mron should be embarrassed or that he 's weak . essentially mocking him for what took place . Other reactions were more serious saying that shoving the apparent shove by Breijit towards Macron is unacceptable . We can see this post here says even it does n't matter who it is , if it 's domestic violence , it must be reported . There 's also been some French politicians that have weighed in as well . this is a far- MP in France who says , "" Imagine a big fight if this is a banal squabble . "" Now , there 's also been a lot of AI photo and video that has been circulating as well based off this image . I think this is one that is circulating a lot at the moment . It 's based on the French TV news style of BFM . and it is extends the moment . it 's clearly made by AI , but it extends the moment that we see happen . So it is based on that moment and in this AI version the tussle continues as they go forward . and this audio is also pretty cruel as well . We can hear Macron there saying Jean Michichelle stop . And this is based off a conspiracy theory that went viral earlier this year questioning the sex of Breijit Macron that she was born male . Now I just want to end with this that the couple is no stranger to online hate or conspiracy theories . they have been subject to a lot of scrutiny and fascination about their relationship due to their 25 - y year age difference and the fact that she was his teacher at school . But Sharon , that 's all we know about this video and what people are saying at this time . Verica , thanks so much for all of that . Vica Bahal there with tonight 's truth or if fake ."
https://youtu.be/GnQ9DY4vzLc?si=rbm-Ewe3LfDXZt1k,French farmers push for risky pesticide re-introduction,France 24 English,GnQ9DY4vzLc,"Now , French farmers are holding a small but symbolic protest outside the National Assembly . The body is currently taking up a bill drafted by the Senate that would loosen up regulations . Farmers , however , fear that MPs from the far - left and French Greens will scale back the bill to address environmental concerns . For more on this story , we can bring in our international affairs editor , Angela Diffy . Angela , good to see you . There 's always a certain weariness here in France when farmers come out to protest . What exactly is the issue here ? . this is a show of force by French farmers . There are n't that many in front of the assembly national . It 's much more a shot across the boughs to say we are watching if things do n't go their way then we can expect a turbocharging of their actions as tends to be the tradition here in France . what is at stake ? a bill is being debated in the parliament today , the Duplon bill and it would in fact loosen regulations on farmers . Most in the farming community are in favor of it , not some smaller organic farmers , but mostly it loosens regulations . It would make it easier to construct buildings for breeding . would make it easier for irrigation reservoirs and most controversially it would reauthorize a banned pesticide which is allowed in much of the rest of the European Union and was banned in France in 2018 and French farmers particularly beetroot and hazelnut farmers say it puts them at a huge disadvantage and so they want this bill passed . some on the far left and the Greens are planning to obstruct this bill . They do n't want these restrictions lifted and that is what is at stake here today . I think it 'll be very interesting to watch how Frana Buou handles this . he is someone who knows the agricultural world well . That is not always the case amongst French prime ministers . Franis Buu is steeped in the rural world down in southwest France . He took over his farmers his father 's farm when he was only 16 and his father died unexpectedly . He really does know that world and the concerns of smaller farmers and bigger farmers . We will watch to see what happens on this . So what should we expect here from all of this ? , what might happen ? because the Greens and the far - left have tabled 3,500 motions to try to obstruct this . That 's quite within the rules . We see this on with other issues as well . but those in favor of the B bill mostly on the some on the center and the far are considering what is called a rejection motion which is a mechanism under which they can stop debate and it can go back to an interparliamentary committee . Now the speaker of the French house does n't want that . parliament is supposed to be a place where debate can be had . She 's not very keen on that idea . It 's one of those moments where there 'll be , , a bit of drama and theater in the French National Assembly today . It nothing that they agree on will probably matter . They 're unlikely to agree , , to pass this bill today . So , it 's it 's more a moment of theater in the French National Assembly . And of course , it always reinforces these camps , the rural the parties that feel they have a connection with deep rural France . That 's mostly the , the far , the center and the parties that their critics say are too urban have a romantic , idealistic , outofouch view of what really happens in the in the countryside and what matters to make a livelihood in the countryside . So , it 's always interesting to watch . Interesting . We 'll see what happens . and Zula , thank you very much for"
https://youtu.be/aNKTH6NtCfk?si=TusE316-4T_I1r-V,"Hamas agrees to US proposal on Gaza ceasefire, Palestinian official says",France 24 English,aNKTH6NtCfk,"But first , at least 52 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza on Monday , including in overnight attacks on a schoolturn shelter . The IDF says they targeted militants which had been operating from the premises . The Israeli army , meanwhile , has also issued new evacuation notices for Kunis . As a military offensive in the enclave gathers pace , international condemnation continues to intensify . Germany has become the latest country to question Israel 's goal in Gaza . We can now bring in our correspondent Noat Tanapolski standing by in Jerusalem . And , , we have news coming in that Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire proposal by the United States . What do we know about the proposal and the pressure coming in from Washington ? , we do n't have full details yet and in fact we have a little bit of a contradiction . Reuters , as you said , is reporting that Hamas has agreed to a US Gaza ceasefire plan . I 'm reading this because it 's from minutes ago and that this ceasefire plan would include the release of 10 Israeli hostages over a period of 70 days in two stages . Now , we understand from the Israeli government and from President Trump that at least 20 or 21 Israeli hostages are still alive . So this is a partial plan at best and it 's a ceasefire that would last 70 days . However , a Hamas official speaking to the Alud 's television channel issued a somewhat contradictory statement also just in the last few minutes saying that Hamas has agreed to a US proposal for a permanent ceasefire that would indicate an end to the war and we can suppose the release of all of the Israeli hostages alive and dead . So clearly something is being hooked up in the background now , but we do n't yet fully know . And also that would also mean an end to the war and Israeli withdrawal of the enclave because also while all of this is going on , we had that the Gaza humanitarian fund , a big blow to this organization that was about to get up and running after its head Jake Wood resigned saying the organization could not adhere to the principles of impartiality and neutrality . What do we know about this fund ? , here also we have some breaking news which I will read to you aloud . The leader of the Israeli opposition , Ya Laid , just suggested in parliament in the Israeli Knesset that it is the Israeli government using front companies abroad that is funding this entire aid proposal . And I 'm emphasizing this because US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabe just last week said that it is wholly untrue to say that Israel is behind this initiative for aid distribution . However , now we 're hearing from the leader of the Israeli opposition that it appears to be some semi - secret or subversive Israeli effort . And the spokesperson for this for Yaer Leid , the leader of the Israeli opposition has gone further and is asking whether Israeli security personnel and Israeli funds were not sent abroad so as to organize this entire procedure , which if it 's the case , I think is at least a borderline legal maneuver on Israel 's part . And as you said , this organization of which we know very little , lost its CEO today . He himself hinting that he was leaving because he realized he could not maintain the humanitarian and independent values that he had vowed to keep . And Noa , all this is happening on Jerusalem day . Earlier today , we had Israel 's farright national security minister Bengavir who was at Temple Mount with a rabbi as well . not just with the rabbi , with several Israeli members of the parliament , with a few more ministers behaving in blatantly illegal ways , including lying down in front of the mosque of Al Axa , prostrating themselves in prayer . All of this while of course , Itamar Benpir is the minister for national security , so the minister in charge of police . And as we speak , Delano , there are extremely violent incidents taking place in the old city of Jerusalem around Damascus Gate with hooligans and thugs who are progovern Netanyao government , pro Benvir , assaulting Palestinians and assaulting Israel police officers . it 's an almost out of control situation now and still very much developing . , thank you very much for the update . No gatana policy reporting there for us from Jerusalem ."

He 's advising shoppers on seasonal fruits and vegetables and he 's especially knowledgeable about local produce . These are varieties of guava that are practically impossible to find anymore . Royal guava , it 's incredible . Source up fruit that you almost could n't find at all . Leafy vegetables the moringa . We cook it a bit spinach . , you sauté it in a pan . The fact they 're grown without pesticides is also a draw for customers in Guadaloop , where claudic was used on crops until the 1990s . For a very long time , we did n't know what could we eat . And in the major supermarkets , you had always the same things , tomatoes , corettes , cucumbers . So , people were hesitant about buying local products because we were n't familiar with them and where they came from . Buying local means better value , too . € 20 for 10 kilos . A lot cheaper than imported produce . Customers are free to select the fruit and vegetables they . I 've got salad , cocoa , I 've got some sour sock , too . If you compare it to what in the shop , it 's really worth coming here . I 'm surprised to see that it 's € 20 for all this . I can share it with my daughter and I think it 's enough for two or three days . Saleem keeps his prices competitive thanks to a cooperative of around 15 local farmers . Kamay is one of them . Given the chloricone poisoning of the past , Salem makes sure that the soil is safe and free from any toxins . Here , our farmers eat their own produce . Elsewhere , you would n't see a farmer eating his own crop , even if you paid him . Too many pesticides . But here , it 's natural . It 's healthy . Delicious . The soil here has been certified by an independent body . Jean 's only helping hand is a natural one . A variety of millipede whose excrement keeps the earth well fertilized . The idea is n't to have a really big tomato . It 's to have a healthy one . It 's not about growing an enormous guava . It 's about having a healthy one . That way , I know I 'm providing highquality food for my neighbors . Getting people to adopt a balanced diet is another of Sem 's missions . Since in Guadaloop , more than half of the adult population is overweight or obese . That 's why he organizes regular cookery classes here at the fruit and veg stall , passing on ancestral knowhow to prepare healthy dishes . , ladies . . We 've got some green mango recipes that are very old . Exactly . Wulka . We serve this as an entree or a sauce . There 's a nutritionist on hand for tips and advice . And the participants are quick to admit that they 've been choosing convenience a little too often . I think we got too used to eating rice , pasta , too much frozen food , ready meals , stuff in the microwave . The idea is to demonstrate that a simple , healthy three course meal can be prepared in just an hour . We 're getting back to the authentic flavors of these ingredients without adding any preservatives , no additives , just using the simple spices that grow locally . Guadaloop boasts 250 different varieties of fruit and vegetables . Abundance and diversity , which means the sky 's is the limit in the kitchen ."
https://youtu.be/fGWOkUFXY8o?si=MszfZORjrhZ6AfKX,Russia sent a record number of drones into Ukraine as Trump says Putin has 'gone crazy',France 24 English,fGWOkUFXY8o,", for more on this , I 'm joined by France 24 's Doug Herbert . Doug , is this a real shift from Trump on policy , or is this just more rhetoric ? , he 's trying to save face now . Look , we know the narrative . There 's nothing new in what I 'm saying . Donald Trump claimed time and again , repeatedly during his campaign , it 's become , it 's so cliched now . He would end the war in 24 hours . He later claimed that was sarcastic when everyone , every reporter kept throwing it back in his face . He got infuriated by this 24 - hour claim . The timeline had been extended a little bit , but Donald Trump had pitched himself as he does with not just Ukraine war , but just about everything as the master negotiator , the man who is so savvy in the art of the deal that , he is just unmatched . He runs up against the reality of a Vladimir Putin who not only works on his own terms but works according to his own clock and he 's not going to get anyone , not even the so - called master negotiator , Mr. Art of the Deal , Donald Trump , to make him bend to his will . So what we have now is Donald Trump essentially with the potential of having egg on his face . He 'll never say it explicitly this way , but seeming to be a man who is not able to make good on his promise to end the war . So rather than stepping up and saying this is proving much more complicated , much more complex , much more nuanced , the people I 'm dealing with have much more embedded positions than perhaps I had anticipated or knew about when I was campaigning . what he 's doing is backing away . He 's pulling out . He 's trying to save face . he does n't want Vladimir Putin to make more of a mockery of his claims of being the master negotiator than perhaps Putin already has . and he 's Putin 's calling Trump 's bluff at the same time . So , Donald Trump backing off . It does n't mean it means he 's backing off from the ceasefire talks , ? From the US implication in the ceasefire talks . does n't mean , and this is very important , that he 's backing away from his pursuit of some deal with Russia . He wants the money , the glitzy stuff . He wants the economic deals . He wants the trade deals with Russia . He wants its energy and its mineral resources and all of that . He wants Russia to open up as an economic partner , but he does n't want to have to do that dirty work of getting down in the dirt and having to do tough negotiations that might drag on a while . He wanted those over quickly so that he could get what he really wanted , the type of stuff he took away from his M East trip , which are the deals , the money , the minerals , the energy , so on and so forth . He 's not getting that . So given all of that , what effect might Trump 's stepping back have on these ceasefire talks or on what 's happening between Russia and Ukraine at the moment ? I 'll use a big word , nefarious , meaning a very dam damaging and bad effect . What do by that ? Ukraine 's foreign minister has made very clear in recent days that really the US implication , US involvement is absolutely necessary realistically in order to bring an end to this war on anything even vaguely resembling the terms that Ukraine says it absolutely has to have . That is terms that do not amount to full - scale capitulation to Russia . As things now stand , just about all those terms do amount to , as Ukraine sees it , full capitulation . Europe simply does n't have the punching power . It does n't have the political influence now . And Putin is counting on the fact that you have the these diverging paths as we stand here today between Europe and the administration , the US administration of Donald Trump . Putin is savily or not so savily , consciously or not consciously , I think he 's consciously doing this . His gambit is to drive the US and Europe apart , knowing that Europe on its own does n't have a snowballs chance in hell of changing the outcome of this war between Ukraine and Russia . That without US involvement , Russia will essentially , if not be able to fully dictate the terms of how this war ends , it will have really quite the upper hand now . It now has the ability to domestically mass - produce a lot of its own drones . As we 've seen in recent days , a lot of those drones are no longer being produced in Iran as they had been previously . , so it has the weapons making ability . It still has the troop ability because you just throw men cannon fodder into the front lines . , and Putin will see himself as having the upper hand even if a lot of outside military observers say that Russia 's taken quite a devastating toll throughout this war . Doug , thank you for that . At Prince 24 is Doug Herbert ."

These are as always meant to inflict as much misery as possible on the civilian population in order to bring the Ukrainians to their knees . They do n't necessarily pursue military aims . I think the military offensive is a separate thing . We 're already seeing signs of it in the Sunumi region etc . But but important I think in as well as sending the signal that Russia is just as fixated on Ukraine is doing it not only addressing the Ukrainians but also I think sending it to Ukraine 's European allies . No amount of peacemaking on the part of Donald Trump will sway Putin and will make him change his mind that he wants to control all of Ukraine . So will he just keep going then as long as it takes ? What manpower and resources does Russia have to sustain this war ? , by all indications , Russia 's economy has had , , better days . But what once again whatever misery the current economic situation inflicts on the ordinary Russians . Vladimir Putin thinks that with his dose of propaganda , his carrot and stick that he uses with the Russians , his repression methods are enough to overcome any unhappiness by the Russians whether they decide to rise up or there 's any protests around the country . Putin feels confident that he can quell whatever uprising that may arise and we 're not seeing any signs of that . On the other hand the European allies of Ukraine continue to proaricate there continuing continuously looking for a formula of how best to Ukraine while Ukraine is bleeding and Donald Trump is simply missing an action . my guess that one can be encouraged can feel encouraged that finally after days of silence Donald Trump is commenting on these extremely cruel bombardments that we 've undergone for the past 3 days but once again he 's only talking about a possibility of sanctions . Vladimir Putin does not feel there 's a credible threat coming from Washington . And so then where does this leave Ukraine ? It leaves Ukraine . , I 'm I 'm I 'm I 'm afraid increasingly one with Vladimir Putin . , even if Ukraine Europe keeps going through motions that we will , , stay with our ally , the Ukrainians , , the matter of fact is , , Ukraine is running out of ammunitions . We 're running out of our air defense systems . Europe should better come up with a plan soon how to fill the gap from America 's decision to just simply walk away . There 's a formula being discussed now . Europe will pay for America 's ammunition . And once again , the golden solution here is to use Russia 's frozen 300 billion US dollars sitting in European banks to help achieve that . . But you feel that is unlikely from the US point of view . for I believe that it 's very much in accord with Donald Trump 's policy that America 's interest first . , if you do n't want to give anything away to any anyone even in Ukraine , this would put , , Donald Trump up against the wall . , , , let 's see if you 'll be willing to sell the weapons . If he does n't , then he 's clearly acting in the interest of Vladimir Putin . So I think this is a this is I think a workable solution but once again I think Europeans should come up with that decision should decide quickly because Ukraine does not have much time to wait . Mr. Peter Almev of the Eurasia Democracy Initiative thank you so much for your time ."
https://youtu.be/K6R85_PNWgk?si=6Ck9DHU26m1kC3kN,Vietnam president agrees with Macron to deepen cooperation with France,France 24 English,K6R85_PNWgk,"Now we 're going to talk about it in today 's Asia View and our Beijing correspondent Yenna Lee is joining us as ever for that . Yenna the French president Emanuel Macron on a three - legg tour then in Southeast Asia . What 's he trying to achieve overall with this then ? in his own words Stuart President Emanuel Macron is in the region to tell his counterparts that France is a peaceful power and a reliable partner . on his account on X , the latest post about his Southeast Asia tour reads , "" Whilst some choose to look inwards , France chooses to build bridges . "" So , Macro is once again pitching this idea that countries in Asia should and could look towards France for economic deals and defense partnerships . Parish really wants France to be seen as a regional power and an alternative to the China US rivalry in the Indo - Pacific . That 's what he wants to achieve . Now , will this be easy ? , . when it has n't been so far . Paris just is n't the traditional partner in this part of the world . It 's not because France has some territory in the Pacific Ocean that it 's seen or considered to be a regional powerhouse . Far from it . We are geographically speaking somewhat in China 's backyard and it 's a place where the United States has strong military presence . Think of Japan , the Philippines , South Korea , PNG , etc . Of course , the French strategy is n't really about seriously overtaking anyone , but more about becoming an active player in the region , especially in this changing geopolitical context . One where China is being more and more assertive when it comes to territorial claims , and one where the United States is becoming increasingly unpredictable and unreliable . So after living through a pandemic and these trade wars , it 's perhaps a very interesting time for middle powers and emerging economies to think about diversification and how to integrate that not just into their supply chains but also with their strategic partnerships . . Now , as ever in Asia View , I know you to tell us something a little bit quirky , a little bit fun . , we 're going to talk about a tariff proof Chinese toy . I 'm not even sure I know how to say this . Is it a labubus ? A labubus ? They 're all over social media apparently . They 've been spotted at Paris Fashion Week and there 's even been a brawl at the Laboo London store . What 's this about their gremlin looking toys ? Is that ? , St. It 's a craze that 's been around for about a year now and it 's just not abating . Laboos are these furry little monsters with teeth and you can attach them to your handbags and they 've really blown up all over the world . created by a Hong Kong designer and sold by PopMart , a Chinese chain known for its blind boxes . So , the concept is that buyers do n't really know which model they 're going to get and they which toy is inside . And the trend has really gone viral with influencers who unbox their surprise models and celebrities even such as Rihanna or do a Lipper who have been seen carrying a little leuoo with them . Scarcity of some models really makes them even more coveted and owners are often matching them with designer handbags . Some fans are even collecting them in their dozens . In the UK , prices are around 13 to50 , but rare models can go up to hundreds of pounds on resale websites . The Laboo trend has certainly boosted Popmark 's revenue and we can see that with their North American headquarters saying that and they 've gone up in profits by 726 % in one year . But with this great success sometimes comes a little bit of rowdiness . Apparently customers got reportedly into some fights at a PopMart store in London a few days ago . So , from now until June , you wo n't be able to buy a Laboo monster at any of the UK Pop Mart stores , only online . Market experts say that this temporary ban will only make the collectibles even more coveted . So , even though some trends come and go , it really seems it 's just not the end of this trend yet . , I 'm so glad to hear it . You can tell my kids have grown up a bit . Although , from what you 're saying there , Yen , it 's not just kids , it 's adults as well . I bet you got several yourself . Laboo . Is that ? Not yet , but I hope . . Leubu , bit Yogi Bear . Some people will understand that . Henia with Asia View on France"
https://youtu.be/5uZ4TAtfAjg?si=7fVLIwc32AyTpZ9T,European markets rally as Trump delays 50% EU tariffs,France 24 English,5uZ4TAtfAjg,"Now , the US President Donald Trump has packed away from his threat to slap 50 % tariffs on imports from the European Union next month . He 's agreed to extend that deadline until July the 9th for talks between Washington and the 27 nation block to produce a deal . That after a phone call with the European Commission President Ursula Vunderline , where she told him that EU needed more time to come to an agreement . , we 're going to cross now live to Brussels talk to our correspondent Dave Keiting who joins us from there . Dave , a huge relief at least for now , would you say , for Europe ? For sure . There is huge relief here in Brussels . Although I should say that talking to people over the weekend , I could not find anyone here who thought that 50 % tariffs were going to take effect on June 1st . So , it 's not so much surprise at the announcement we had last night . The part of it that is surprised is how quickly Donald Trump backed away from that threat . Just 48 hours . It 's not clear what President Fondonder might have said to him to reassure him . Probably the more likely explanation here is that this was always a maximalist threat and that they wanted to act before the US markets opened today because the US markets already reacted very badly to that news on Friday . now this new date July 9th is the end of the extension for the liberation day tariffs that were announced two months ago . that 's on 20 % for the EU . Donald Trump backed off of that , gave 3 months extension in order to have negotiations . So that 's the context in which this 50 % threat came on Friday when there was supposed to be an extension until July 9th . That was the agreement . So now we 're back to the agreement , however , with the new threat of 50 % tariffs instead of the existing threat of 20 % tariffs . now we have a group of members of the European Parliament going to DC today to try to talk to the White House . I think that 's very unlikely that they 're going to be successful in that . really it 's the commission that conducts these trade negotiations and we 're supposed to have a meeting between Merchovich , the EU trade commissioner , and his US counterpart in June , I believe in Paris . so we 'll see what happens there . The biggest problem that I 'm hearing now is that EU officials just can not get US officials on the phone . It 's worth noting that this phone call between Fonder and Trump last night was the first time that they 've spoken since Trump took office in January . The White House has rebuffed her attempts to have substantive conversation with him , although they did chat briefly at the Pope 's funeral . so it has just been very difficult for EU officials to get US officials at a high level on the phone to try to talk this out . Dave , meanwhile , , preparations continuing though in case , of course , the deal falls through and it is a 50 % tariff , but is Europe ready ? . So , if this does take effect immediately , we 're going to see an unpausing of the retaliation that was already agreed and voted on . , that 's on 20 billion of goods that would be coming from imported from the US to the EU . , that takes effect immediately . But then earlier this month , we also got a consultation on possible further measures that would impact € 100 billion worth of goods . Now , that 's a drop in the bucket compared to well , not a drop in the bucket . It 's much less than the 350 billion euros that would be affected by Trump 's trade measures . However , they are pretty significant . They would target aircraft , cars , medical devices , things that the US really needs . Also in this consultation , the possibility of restricting exports to the US specifically in steel and chemicals is on the table . Now that consultation is going to be open until June 10th . so national governments are going to be able to again they did last time say can you leave this off the list ? Can you leave that off the list ? but there are that is already a pretty substantial response . And then separately to that the EU can go after the go for the nuclear option as it 's called to put a tariff on services imports for which the EU has a trade deficit with the US . That 's things financial services , internet providers , streaming services , things this , things that are not tangible . That 's also very much under discussion here . So the EU has some very powerful tools in its tool belt to respond if those that 50 % tariff goes forward in July . And from what I 'm hearing , they 're very much prepared to use it . , , I think that there was a debate when it was 20 % , , should we use the nuclear option , should we not ? I 've heard this weekend if it 's 50 % , the EU will have no choice but to go for that nuclear option and tariff services . Dave , thanks very much .

https://youtu.be/BPELE3KJHJA?si=LpTITiNnnJlGrkN_,Five years on: George Floyd's uncertain legacy ,France 24 English,BPELE3KJHJA,"France 24 's international affairs editor Ketavan Gorgistani joins me on set .  Ketavan . So you were of course France 24 's correspondent in the United States when George Floyd was killed . You were also in Minneapolis the days in the days following his death . What can you tell us about how things have evolved over the past 5 years ? look when I arrived in Minneapolis it was the day after the first big riots that left parts of the city pretty destroyed . And what I found when I got there and started speaking to the people in the community there was a mix of sadness at the death and the killing of George Floyd . Also a lot of anger at his death but also in the days going through that after the murder there was a reckoning and not just a reckoning from African - Americans but also of the broader population . And there was a sense when I was speaking to a lot of people in the African - American community that it was finally you non - blacks understand what we 've been saying about systemic racism . Finally you realize that this is more than just police violence . Finally you get it and you are with us on the streets . It 's not just us blacks . It 's everyone . It 's all of the United States and the fact that it happened also coming out of the first lockdown of COVID there was a sense that people needed to get out . People were all together but also they had nowhere else to go . There was no distraction and there felt there was something that was different this time . It spread to all the cities . there was this idea and when the sign Black Lives Matter going up in Washington DC , I was there . I came back from Minneapolis to that street that is across of the White House at the time Donald Trump was there . and there was a feeling that somehow this was different that there was a turning point that there was going to be something to address systemic racism that there was going to be tackling of police violence that things would change going forward . But as we see now the symbol with the Black Lives Matter plaza being torn down 5 years after the death of George Floyd , the efforts by the Trump administration to strike down , rolled back all of the efforts for diversity , equity , and inclusion . all of the efforts to fight racism , discrimination , the executive order to unleash law enforcement , you 're moving back towards siding with the police rather than siding with the community . we heard in the report the DOJ that is now thinking about or stopping to investigate dozens of police departments , not just Minneapolis and Louisville , but no longer looking into those violations of civil rights and across the US local governments also rolling back some of those efforts to try to rein in police violence . And I will end on one moment that I remember from that time and that some of your viewers may remember when George Floyd 's daughter said at some point , "" Daddy changed the world . "" And everybody at that time thought that would be true going forward . And it feels today , not that it 's over , but that it did n't live up to the expectations that we had back in 2020 when all of this happened . Quite a different ambiance indeed . Just 5 years on . and Kavan Gordani . Thank you very much ."
https://youtu.be/p_lRjYbpsHk?si=V_8OCrLCGsKh-GqS,Ukraine and Russia swap more prisoners hours after mass strikes on Kyiv ,France 24 English,p_lRjYbpsHk,"  as we were discussing there , it 's been a very busy couple of days in Russian Ukraine relations . Can you tell us more of what 's been happening on the ground over the past 24 hours ? , there 's been some good news and some bad news when it comes to what is happening in Ukraine . You mentioned one of those prisoner releases , but over the past 24 hours , the there have been two rounds and that was , as you said , agreed in that meeting . in Istanbul . So on Friday , each side released 390 prisoners including soldiers but also civilians . About 120 civilians on each side were released and that was followed today by those 307 prisoners . These all soldiers on each side . That means that we could have probably around another hundred released by the end of this weekend because the initial agreement was to release about 1,000 prisoners over the course of these several rounds . So , we 'll see if that happens maybe later today or tomorrow . And while there have been regular smaller prisoner swaps since the start of the full - scale invasion in 2022 , it has never happened on this scale . 1,000 in a few days is going to be a huge prisoner swap and a huge agreement between Russia and Ukraine . and one thing that has been noted and announced by the Russians is that once these 1,000 prisoners on each side are released , Moscow is likely to give Keev a draft document outlining its conditions for what it has called a sustainable long - term comprehensive peace agreement . But , and there is a big butt , of course , the these two releases bookended what is seen as probably one of the largest attacks on the Ukrainian capital since the start of the war . 14 ballistic missiles , 250 drones overnight , 15 injured at least in Kev . There were also attacks in the southeast in the north with about a dozen killed according to Ukrainian officials and also possibly three dead in a strike on the port city of Odessa . So you 're seeing at the same time these prisoner releases which are very significant but also Russia stepping up its aggression and its strikes on Ukraine especially on the capital . . So , we 're seeing them say one thing and do something else . , what can we make of this sequence of events as you were going into detail there with these swaps and these strikes that are happening simultaneously in the context of possibly broader talks for peace negotiation between Russia and Ukraine ? , look , some have pointed to the prisoner swaps as a reason for optimism . that was the case in Istanbul from the mediators of those talks the Turkish officials but also on Friday after the first swap Donald Trump the US president taking to his social media platform to wonder whether this could lead to something big following that prisoner swamp . But the massive strikes that I was describing overnight tell a different story . And that story was what Vladimir Zalinski was pointing to in his own post this time on X where he was saying that with each attack by the Russians , the world becomes more certain that the causes of prolonging the war lie in Moscow . He called once again on the United States , on the Europeans , on other of Ukraine 's supporters to step up sanctions on Russia , saying that it was the only way to force Moscow to a ceasefire . now , there is a discrepancy between the reaction from Washington and the reaction from the other of Ukraine 's allies . in Washington . It seems that they 're still willing to give Vladimir Putin the benefit of the doubt , but the European leaders especially agree with Zalinski . Back on Thursday , I was at the French foreign ministry . and I asked the spokesperson there what they thought of the strategy of the Russian and the response was that the language of the Russians was hypocritical and that Russia was simply pretending that it was willing to negotiate for peace but was doing everything to avoid a peaceful solution concluding that Russia was simply playing the clock running out the time and when it comes to the negotiations Also , you have to see that Russia has n't really moved from its initial maximalist demands . It has n't it has agreed to possible new round of talks , but that 's it . It has n't agreed to possibly any compromises on its initial demand , and it still to this day has not agreed to that unconditional 30 - day ceasefire that was proposed by the United States , supported by the Europeans , and most importantly agreed to immediately by the Ukrainians . That 's . I guess we 'll have to see , how long Donald Trump 's patience holds out on this . , thank you so much for joining us . That 's France 24 's foreign affairs editor , Ketivan Gorgistani ."
https://youtu.be/xAvO2CYg5AQ?si=Xw7wwO_7JYwtkZxy,Kim Kardashian robbers sentenced to up to 3 years in prison for Paris heist ,France 24 English,xAvO2CYg5AQ,"just tell us exactly about the verdicts and that have been handed down . , Jean . So , as you said of the 10 standing on trial this month , eight judged guilty on various counts of armed robbery and abduction , possession of weapons or complicity in the assault . of these eight four the four main suspects got seven to eight years of prison of which two to three years are a probation period . If not respected they will then be sent to prison for the remaining five years and these are the mastermind the deemed mastermind behind the heist alma kash . he very appeared tonight very weak in court . He is a partially mute and partially deaf man . and of course his reaction was one of defeat and sadness . And also Gier Jub who was too ill to be present today . He is currently undergoing chemotherapy was also sentenced to 7 years in prison guilty of abduction and kidnapping . Now there were other accompllices who were sentenced to up to four to 5 years in prison charged with complicity in an armed robbery . Now these accused will be put on a probation period first . As I said , if it is not respected , they will then be sent to prison . And during this probation period , they are not allowed to be in contact with any of the other co - authors of the heist , nor be in possession of any weapons , nor of course enroll on another path of committing any other offenses . So , their risk of reaffending will constantly be monitored . Now , only two of the defendants were fully acquitted . this is because the judge the court deemed there was not enough evidence not enough elements for the jury to provide a verdict and say that they were guilty . but all in all very heavy size tonight in the courtroom . at the beginning there was a lot of anxiety in fact the anxiety was palpable especially from the family and the friends sitting on the public benches and also the journalists on the journalist benches . so this and this verdict tonight has closed what is one of the most sensational celebrity crime cases in recent memory . And Liza , we also getting word from Kim herself , saying she 's deeply grateful to the French authorities . She 's also said the crime was the most terrifying experience of her life . It left a lasting impact on her and her family . you mentioned all those reactions in the courthouse . if you can just take us back to the events and remind our viewers exactly what happened to Kim that led to these this outpouring of emotion . for someone who 's such a big star on the international stage , this has still left a very deep impact on her as a human being . Indeed . So Kim Kardashian was in the courtroom herself just last week where she came to testify a very emotional testimony . She recalled that night in October 2016 when three men entered her room while she was packing and dressed in simply a bathrobe . and she recalled feeling terrified and questioning whether this was a terrorist attack and also fearing that perhaps she would be raped or killed . and she described being bound , her mouth being taped shut , and the overwhelming fear of what will happen next . And the meast star said that terrifying night reshaped her entire life . she no longer posts on social media in real time . She struggles to sleep at night without constant security and she never wears expensive jewelry anymore in public . and so the judge in this court did take a moment at the very end to remind all of the those now sentenced to prison , those sentenced to many years in prison that they inflicted although no blood was shed , they inflicted fear they inflicted fear on their victims . they inflicted trauma on their victims and he reiterated that this is something to really keep in mind and did tell them to stay vigilant . again they were notified that they if they do not respect the probation period they will be sent to jail . now again looking at their reactions they seemed very they seemed very determined to respect the probation period . but we will have to see what happens next . Apologetic to say the least . Liza Kamino , thank you so much and I 'm sure we 'll be getting more reaction from the courts and from Kim and her family themselves as always . Lisa are coming off . Thank you so much"
https://youtu.be/4_38L0KXT6s?si=S01o7UTVbV54JYqi,Prosecutors seek 10-year term for alleged leader of Kardashian Paris robbery trial,France 24 English,4_38L0KXT6s,"  reporter Lisa Kamov . Great to have you on the program , Lisa . What happened in court today ? So , today we heard the closing statements of the defense before the court entered deliberations just hours ahead of the much anticipated verdict . so there are 10 people standing trial . Eight of them have maintained their innocence in their last words . two did partially confess and this is due to their DNA traces being found on the scene . Now among them the alleged mastermind behind the heist , Mr. Alma Ait Kadesh . he is deaf and nearly mute . And so today he had his lawyer read out a letter on his behalf in which he stated , "" I 'm very sorry and a thousand apologies go to my son . "" Those were his words , but no mention of Kim Kardashian . Now prosecutors have called Kadash a seasoned criminal . He has had five prior convictions , the earliest one dating back to the 1970s . And in this case , he is accused of having recruited the accompllices and stolen , sorry , sold the stolen jewelry in Belgium . and so another of the defendants , Dier Dub , was the one who could n't make it to court today . He is undergoing chemotherapy . And so his lawyer read out his final message in which he acknowledged the trauma inflicted on the victims but maintained his innocence . Now the accused nine men and one women who are now in their late 60s and early 70s are facing charges of robbery , abduction , kidnapping and complicity with the assault and under French law they could face up to 30 years in prison . As you said , deliberations have been underway all day between the magistrates and a jury of randomly selected French citizens who are weighing all of this evidence before the verdict which could be announced in the coming hours and could close one of the most shocking celebrity crime cases in recent memory . Talk us through the case with Kim Kardashian 's testimony cuz what was it a week ago or so ? Very emotional . She was talking about how the trauma affected her until now . tell us about that and also just remind us again what the prosecution are asking for in terms of these sentences . So in terms of the sentences the prosecution made their closing statements two days ago and they were asking for up to 10 years in prison for the lead suspect and their accompllices . they urged the court to not be swayed by appearances or age . they 're reminding everyone that this group dubbed the Grandpa Robbers did pull off a meticulously planned and rather violent heist . They did make off with almost $ 10 million of jewelry and did leave Kim Kardashian tied , gagged , and had held her at gunpoint . So , while many of the accused are currently battling illnesses from lung cancer to Parkinson 's , the prosecutor did insist that they should be held accountable . They should face time in prison and urged the court to balance justice with consideration of their health , their age , and the risk of reaffending . Now , in terms of Kim Kardashian 's testimony last week , it was indeed very emotional . the megastar recalled three men entering her room on that night on October 2016 and two of them were dressed as police officers and she was packing and she was only wearing a bathrobe and so she described how scared and confused she was thinking it was a terrorist attack and also having thoughts that she could be raped or killed . the mega star also spoke of how that night reshaped the entire way she thought and her life after that . She no longer posts in real time on social media . She ca n't sleep at night without full - time security and she stopped wearing expensive jewelry . So a very traumatizing experience for her . And in one particularly emotional moment in the court , Kardashian was read out a letter from a defendant expressing remorse to which she said , "" I forgive you , but it does n't change the emotion and trauma which I experienced . "" And so her testimony is what some may say was the emotional high point of her trial , which has drawn huge public interest and reignited debate in society about the toll of being famous and living life in the spotlight . Briefly , Liz , would around you there 's a there 's a celebrity trial going on ? Does it feel it today ? It does not feel it . because we are at the very end of this trial and Kim Kardashian herself was not present in court . However , a week ago on the 13th of May , when the celebrity walked up the stairs of the B deis , it did indeed feel an incredibly mediatized very big trial . we recall that the benches on the public 's side were completely full as well as the benches of the press who were following the trial . the court was packed with many following it very closely . but of course despite the numbers being slightly less today , the verdict is much anticipated and this is why the court will be reconvening in the coming hour to await the final decision of the magistrates and the jury . and Liz are good to"
https://youtu.be/LgKzmemWfng?si=HzVUt_jG8xv8_N8U,President Donald Trump threatens 50% tariffs on European Union,France 24 English,LgKzmemWfng,", after weeks of back and forth at the beginning of the year , there had been some hope over the past couple of weeks or so that Donald Trump could walk back some of his most extreme tariff threats , especially after that surprise truce was struck with China . , the US president brought his threats back yet again Friday , saying on his truth social platform that he 's recommending a 50 % tariff on the European Union starting from June the 1st . And this because trade talks with the block have stagnated , according to Donald Trump . from where we 're going to cross now to our Washington correspondent Fraser Jackson . So , Fraser . What what bone does the US president have to pick now with the EU at least this time around ? , from talking to sources , I understand it that the US administration was trying to talk to different countries individually about certain aspects of tariffs that they could bring forward . that was effectively kaoshed by the European Union who said that all discussions had to be done at the Brussels level and that is what 's been therefore going on for the last few months and this clearly has led to some source of frustration with the administration . Donald Trump in the earlyish hours of Friday morning taking to True Social once again to lambast the European Union . he says once again that it was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on trade has been very difficult to deal with . He says their powerful trade barriers , VAT taxes , ridiculous corporate penalties , non - monetary trade barriers , monetary manipulations , unfair and unjustified lawsuits against American companies and more have led to a trade deficit with the US of more than $ 250 billion a year . A number which is totally unacceptable . I should say as well it 's a number that is slightly overinflated . It is about 230 billion so the trade deficit that the US has with the EU . But Trump continues our discussions with them are going nowhere . Therefore , I 'm recommending a straight 50 % tariff on the EU starting on the on June the 1st . There is no tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the US . So that therefore representing an increase of 20 % even on the number from what has been currently implicated put on China at the moment . so it would mean it would be a significant tariff for EU products and it is a key partner for the EU as well . Last year there was $ 975 billion worth of trade between the two . I said that deficit from the US about 235 billion and most EU exports to the US were pharmaceuticals , machinery and vehicles . But I said as well , there is a bit of a B in the bonnet here from Donald Trump . He 's lashed out at the European Union numerous times . The EU Council on Foreign Relations says that he has a negative view of the EU because of its big trade surplus with America , but also because of the EU 's size and economic power , which makes it a tough negotiator . and also we saw in that tweet because it twins tends to find American companies as well . Many of which of course are owned by his friends . Donald Trump also sees the EU as a bastion of liberal democratic values . Trump would call them probably woke ideology . And this is of course are the things that he 's been trying to actively strip out of the US government since he retook office . But that on a more po person personal level as well . We also saw a quick example as to why he has such a negative view of the EU when he met with the Irish leader inside the Oval Office because he wrongly believes that it prevented him from developing his golf course in Ireland as he said I said inside the Oval Office . So that red tape also one of the negative things that Donald Trump sees about the EU . For now Fraser , the EU commission has declined to comment on the threat . They say that 's pending a phone call between the block trade chief and his counterpart in Washington set to take place later today . So what reaction do you expect to potentially see from Europe ? , the Europeans have been quite tight- lipped around this even when you work trying to work many different angles , they 're all trying to keep a united front . I talked to one senior source inside of Brussels and yesterday they said that Maro Stefkovich the commissioner for trade will be having a phone call today with the US trade representative Greer . Now the source stresses that this call was planned before this recent announcement by Donald Trump . but of course that call will now have a significant amount of it wrapped around this tweet and this threat now of this 50 % tariff . But otherwise the EU is remaining somewhat tight lipped again even on the country specific level they 're trying to maintain that united front . But the EU will likely form ranks and create a solid a solid front against this as well . they are aware that the US does a lot of business dealings with the EU . The EU is a key partner and of course at the end of the day many economists agree that tariffs end up being borne by the end consumer . So the you the cost of these imports that are going to be now hit with this 50 % tariff here in the United States will ultimately probably end up getting passed on to the end consumer and the EU will be hoping that the end result will be somewhat negative for Donald Trump and that for that therefore will cause him to back off from this higher tariff line of 50 % . That trade saga continues then Fraser Jackson in Washington . Thank you ."

Deepd , Germany has deployed a battalion of troops overseas for the very first time since the Second World War . , that 's , Allison . And it is dominating the German dailies today . This is a rhinesta post on the front page here . going with this headline here , deep in the east , it says on its front page , German Chancellor Friedrich Mertz was in Vius , Lithuania yesterday to oversee the deployment of about 5,000 German soldiers to the country . The post saying that he expressed Germany 's determination to work with NATO and its partners to defend the alliance against any aggression . this article from the Frankfurt Algamina here entitled B and V news also looks at this decision examining the significance of this decision to station troops there . The paper reminds us that just over 20 years ago , German troops were stationed in Afghanistan , but at the time it was a it was temporary operation . The deployment of troops to Vnius is the first time since the Second World War that German troops will be stationed abroad permanently . I quote , "" Unlike Afghanistan , this is not an asymmetrical fight against a hidden enemy . It 's about national defense against the army of the Russian dictatorship . "" The German Daily also evoking what it calls the end of any illusions we may have about Russia . And there 's also a bit of skepticism in the German papers today . , there 's this article also from a Frankfurt to Daily called Frankfurt to run show . and in this in this article that is you can find on their website today . it expresses its concern at how feasible this permanent foreign deployment is . calling it nonetheless a quote remarkable move . The paper says that this feel - good movement is temporary . it questions notably how Germany is even going to be able to keep its promise of ensuring the security of its NATO partners when it lacks both soldiers and weapons . the paper really reminding us that the strength of NATO ultimately relies on the US and it 's clear now that the US President Donald Trump is no longer interested in peace in Ukraine . All , we 're going to move on now to something that I have never heard of deeply . The enhanced games . This is a pro - doping highlevel sports competition that has the support of Donald Trump Jr. Yeah , think of it the Olympics for athletes who dope . The enhanced games is what they 're called . And Wired tells us that they 'll be holding their first edition in May 2026 in the city of Sin , Las Vegas . athletes can take performing performance enhancing drugs provided that they are legal , prescribed by a doctor and taken in safe quantities . But anyone who wants to juice can juice . there 'll be about a 100 athletes . The addition will host three sports , swimming , track , and weightlifting . and there 'll be up to $ 1 million in prize money for anyone who breaks a world records for the 100 meter sprint or the 50 meter freestyle . the enhanced games the website tells us is the brainchild of Eron Duza , an Australian bill billionaire businessman who helped litigate fellow billionaire Peter Teal 's case against Gawker Media involving Hulk Hogan that eventually resulted in being the largest invasion of privacy judgment in history . The games also has some solid investor backing , notably from Trump Donald Trump Jr. 's firm 1789 Capital . there 's an interesting article in the Irish Times which says that Las Vegas is the place for the enhanced games . It calls it a sporting freak show with a cast of drugged up athletes , adding that the whole point of this event is to break world records . Otherwise , the event really has no point . The World Anti - Doping Agency , for its part , has called it a dangerous clown show and warn warned that any athletes taking part could face sanctions and penalties if they want to also compete in sports that are regulated by the agency . The writer also has an interesting viewpoint , adding that ultimately the organizers of this event do n't really care about the controversy . The whole point is to spark a conversation about ethics in sports and the limits that exist in sports . and whether we can break those limits or not . I imagine there 's a financial component for them as well , but we 'll see . It 'll be interesting to follow those games . Next , deep onto doping of another sort . A group of British climbers who reached the summit of Mount Everest in six days are facing controversy for how they did it . , you can read about this in the Times of London today , Allison . And this group of climbers in notably four former British special forces soldiers including an MP called Alistair Karens climbed Everest on Wednesday . Their expedition is the first to be first commercial ascent done with Zenon gas . Now , zenon gas is believed to accelerate red blood cell production and reduce the need for a usually long acclimatization period . Now , their preparation involved inhaling this zenon gas at a clinic in Germany 2 weeks prior to their ascent . , and essentially they were able to climb Everest in just 6 days when a typical expedition involves usually takes about 2 months . Now reports are emerging that the group could be or will be summoned by Nepalese authorities over the use of Zen and gas . But the group have denied these reports . Nepal 's tourism chief telling Brit the British press that clear legislation is needed over whether the gas is banned or not . It could also impact local livelihoods as shorter clims of course means reduced needs for porters and support staff ."

The father and daughter have a shared passion , shooting firearms . This rifle was my first gun that I got I got for Christmas from my dad and for Easter I got a lot of these teal parts on it . and I love teal . So at just 13 , she knows how to load and fire the rifle a pro . Are you ready ? Stand by . I shooting just for the thrill of it . It gets my adrenaline rushing and I getting better at it every time . I feel almost powerful , ? It just makes me feel good inside . Jaye regularly practices at this shooting range . According to her father , this training is essential for her to learn how to handle all types of weapons . I think she needs to be able to take care of herself and protect herself with a handgun . Her and her family . Since the age of four , she 's been handling guns . At 8 , she learned how to shoot , but her parents forbid her from using them without their supervision . This is our gun safe where we keep all of our guns . , they 're all locked up . , my wife and I are the only ones that have the combination . Jaylee does not have the combination . I trust myself enough to not make a bad decision . I think you understand the consequences too that if you do make a bad decision , somebody 's could get really hurt or killed . It could be life - changing for somebody or me . Absolutely . Many children in the US her regularly use firearms . There are even young influencers on social media . All , guys . This is a very cool rifle that we have here . For the arms industry , the youth are a burgeoning market . They 're being targeted as potential future clients . This gun store sells hunting rifles , but for several years now , it 's been carrying guns specifically designed for children with playful colors . This little gun is a Savage Rascal . It 's just one of many . So , here 's a bigger gun . So , this is a hunting rifle . This would be a little bit more towards , , a 4 - year - old to a 7 - year - old . This is going to be for a 12year - old , but still more compact . Depending on the state , Americans must be between 18 to 21 in order to purchase a firearm . But nothing prohibits a parent from buying one for their child . The manager tells us that manufacturers are already expanding their market . target shooting numbers and hunting numbers are declining through all states . And so the industry , , has been growing for a long time and now it 's at a point where it has to get creative to try to continue to grow . To attract the younger clientele , the industry is banking on the popularity of video games . On the left , a clip from Call of Duty , and on the , an excerpt from an ad by the firearms maker Smith and Wesson . The resemblance is clear and intentional . you can see a shooter holding the firearm looking at a particular target . , and that is something that teenagers think is really fun in video games because it makes you feel you 're a part of the experience . And gun companies have taken that same approach in terms of trying to make people feel a gun will make them a part of a video game . As a litigator , Aaron Davis has spent her career going after the arms industry , but there are many laws that protect the sector . No manufacturer responded to our request for comment , but in the US , gun violence only seems to be getting worse . Firearm related deaths have become the primary cause of mortality for children and teens , higher than car accidents and cancer . Celia Banks lost her 10 - year - old grandson . That happened quite a bit . This is Michael playing basketball . And this was Michael the day before he died with the team ball that he was awarded . One day after an argument with his siblings , the little boy went into his parents ' room , grabbed the gun from the top of a shelf and shot himself in the head . He had two younger siblings and an older sibling at home and they 're the ones who found him . , if there were not guns accessible , he would n't have thought to go get a gun . A moment of crisis and the gun was there . And the gun is lethal . Last year , Americans purchased 15.3 million firearms . Nearly 4 million were new gun owners , a market the industry wants to continue to expand ."
https://youtu.be/mti6dV-veZw?si=Tvt3VZHC3zmrFKZq,Trump shows photo from DRC as proof of ‘white genocide’ in South Africa,France 24 English,mti6dV-veZw,", it 's time now for our daily factchecking show . Truth or fake ? Vetica Beel joins me in the studio . , Vica . So , we 're staying with this story . As we 've been mentioning , Donald Trump ambushed Ramposa with a clip and news articles that allegedly proved that there is a white genocide against South African farmers . But some of the elements that he showed are in fact misleading . Tell us more . That 's , Yinka . I think we 've all seen the video by now of President Trump insisting to President Ramiposa that there is a genocide taking place against white Africana farmers in South Africa despite Ramaposa 's efforts to fact check . Trump demanded to dim the lights and rolled a clip , even brandished a stack of printed news articles that do that he said documents that persecution . But despite all of that alleged proof Trump has misrepresented the fact . I want to start with these articles in particular . at one point the US president flipped through his paperwork . He says death , death , death on each page . he all says he says that these were all published in the last few days . and that one headline and all the headlines show white farmers being buried . Now at one point in particular , he held up a headline to the camera here . we can see the headline clearly . It says , "" Let 's talk about Africa , which is where tribalism takes you . "" Published by a blog called The American Thinker . there 's also a thumbnail here of bodies being buried as well . Now , this article that he 's holding is still online . It 's pretty easily findable . And unlike what he said about this all being in the last few days , this blog post is not . It 's dated February 13th earlier this year . as for the image that he said there shows white farmers being buried , this is not even in South Africa . This is an image of aid workers burying bodies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . Now , how do we know that ? , it 's pretty clear linked here at the bottom in the blog post itself . It says image YouTube screen grab . pretty easy to click on the link and it takes us straight there to a report published by Indian Media W using Reuters footage showing women being buried following a mass jailbreak in GMA . So , not South Africa Yinka but the DRC . , and it is a story that is months old as well , unlike what Trump claimed in his meeting . And Vica , Trump also was very keen to show that alleged video proof to , President Ramposa as well . Talk us through how accurate that video was . , that 's . Trump was pretty keen to roll his compilation clip . , it started out with archive footage of Julius MMA , who is a South African black nationalist politician . And that 's possibly why President Ramiposa stifled a slight smile when he heard that voice ring out because it is a voice that he recognizes . Now , Malma previously led the ruling ANC party 's youth wing , but he was expelled around 2020 . He has never held an official government position despite Trump 's misconception there . He now leads a minority party in South Africa called the economic freedom fighters . And President Ramaposa did reiterate this to Trump that he is very much a minority with no executive role and this has nothing to do with his government 's official policy . Now later in that compilation clip , there 's also a video an archive video of the former president Jacob Zoomer singing a controversial apartheid era song that includes the lyric shoots the boa the boas of which the descendants of which are the white Africanas in South Africa . Now this is a controversial song . The ANC has did promise to stop singing the song after that . Now , Trump said in this meeting that those singing were officials in office , but this is simply not true . , this video is well over 10 years old with no officials in office shown . Again , Ramiposa did tell Trump directly in the meeting that these videos , these speeches , these rallies in his compilation have little to nothing to do with the way he runs his government . Now , I want to turn to the final video in Trump 's compilation . There it shows white crosses lining a rural highway . Let me bring that up so you can see that better . But this is the video that the president played for President Ramiposa . Trump said that this shows burial sites of over 1,000 white farmers with each cross representing a different farmer that was killed . But these are not graves at all . According to local news , these are this was in fact from a protest in 2020 . So 5 years ago now in memorial for a white farming couple that was killed in their home according to the police report according to the Google Street View dated from 2023 . We can see that these have been removed and that they no longer exist . Now Elon Musk did post this video twice on his platform X in the last 6 months . We can see him sharing that video as well . Now , overall , Trump 's compilation does mislead that there is a wave of anti - white hate and white genocide taking place in South Africa . And whilst the country does have a very high murder rate , it 's around an average of 72 people a day in a country that has a population of 60 million people , most of these victims are black . And I just want to end with these figures from the South African Police Service from 2024 . They recorded over 26,000 murders in 2024 . 44 of these were within the farming community and out of that only eight of those were farmers . Yinka . I think that 's a good point for us to end"
https://youtu.be/WtP5URqwHWo?si=7Cchug-KWfD0ry0y,Who were the Israeli Embassy staffers shot dead days before getting engaged?,France 24 English,WtP5URqwHWo,"But we begin in Washington where a suspect has been arrested after two staff members at the Israeli embassy were shot and killed . The pair were leaving an event at a Jewish museum Wednesday night . The 31 - year - old suspect has been identified as Ilas Rodriguez of Chicago and he shouted free Palestine when he was taken into custody . Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered enhanced security at Israeli missions in the aftermath of that attack . For more on the story , we can go across to Frasier Jackson standing by in Washington . Frrazier , what 's the latest we 're hearing from where you are ? So , the latest we know is that the shooting happened around 9:00 p.m. local time when two staff members of the Israeli embassy were shot at close range outside of the Capsule Jewish Museum in Washington , DC . the two people who are deceased have been described as 30 - year - old Yarren Lashinsky and 26 - year - old Sarah Mgrim , both local hires for the Israeli embassy here in DC . the Israeli ambassador said that the young couple were engaged to be married and they were at an event where the panel was discussing their efforts to get aid into the Gaza Strip . And it 's understood that the pair had both been working with separate associations to try to help Palestinians get more aid into the Gaza Strip . , the suspect who committed this shooting allegedly is a 30 - year - old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago . He 's had no previous contact with police . He was not known to the police , but he was seen loitering outside of the event when he then opened fire on a group of four people , fatally killing two of them . The suspect then threw away his weapon and entered the venue where people inside the venue thought that he had was somebody who had heard the shooting outside and had escaped inside to the venue to try to get away from the shooting . And one witness was talking to him and said , "" Do what this building is ? Do you think that 's why the shooting happened ? "" And he said , "" , , I did it . I did it for Gaza , free Palestine . "" At which point he pulled out a keier from his bag . And was then promptly arrested by event security . , the reactions has been pouring in . Donald Trump in the early hours of the morning called them this shooting a horrible DC killing based obviously on anti - semitism . He said it must end now . Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA . We 're also hearing from other top US officials including the Secretary of Homeland Security Christy Gnome who said we will bring this depraved perpetrator to justice . The highest ranking Jewish official in the US government , Chuck Schumer , said this sickening shooting seems to be another horrific instance of anti - semitism , which as we know is all too rampant in our society . And the Israeli ambassador to the UN called it a depraved act of anti - semitic terrorism . A similar line being struck there by Netanyahu as well , who called the suspect a vile anti - semitic murderer . He 's also ordered the increase of security at embassies and missions worldwide . Frazzia , we of course know that anti - Semitic attacks have increased in the aftermath of those October 7th attacks , whether they we 're talking about here in France or over in the United States . , but I 'm curious to know , has the Trump crackdown on pro Palestinian protest fan tensions where you are ? , as you said , there has been a steady rise in anti - semitism in the US ever since the attacks on October 7 , 2023 . mainly due to the way in which Israel has responded to those attacks and the ensuing images of devastation which have been coming out of the Gaza Strip . Of course , this is a hugely polarizing issue with most Americans feeling an almost instinctive pull and sympathies to the Israelis or the Palestinians . But of course , last year we saw a massive wave of protests on university campuses across the United States . , and since the Trump administration came into office , they 've been actively tracking down students who were involved in those protests and cancelling their visas , it 's become a real touch point here in the United States . The government is now monitoring the social media activity of people it believes were included in those protests and there have been some high - profile arrests of leaders of those protest movements across the US . now of course the outcry has also been swift against that but once again it is a very polarizing issue with Jewish students at the time reporting that they felt unsafe and the war of words is now continuing here as the US continues to vow to crack down on anti - semitic what it calls anti - semitic behavior . It 's even targeting those higher education institutions such as Harvard who experienced those campus protests earlier last year and accusing them of not doing enough to protect Jewish students as well and it 's cancelling a lot of their funding as well . So this is a wide ranging issue here in the US . but of course these senseless killings really mar the waters and are pretty much universally rejected by both sides of the argument . Frasier , thank you very much for that update . Frazzia Jackson reporting there for us from Washington . Now for more on"
https://youtu.be/AzAorsf7kd8?si=Pp5GnQncKwva6f5h,Netanyahu says ordered enhanced security at Israel missions worldwide,France 24 English,AzAorsf7kd8,"We 're going to get a bit more analysis now from France 24 's James Andre who joins me on set . James , what are your thoughts here ? Is this just an isolated incident or could this boil into something more inside the United States ? , quite clearly this specific incident does appear to be someone who 's mentally disturbed and who indeed decided to , , attack these people in front of this event . and , of course , this is an act of anti - semitism and it is very clearly linked to what 's happening in Gaza now . But the fact of the matter is we have a very tense situation in the United States now because indeed the Trump administration has cracked down on any form of dissent or at least protesting when it comes to the war in Gaza . We 've seen this on campuses . We 've seen people being expelled for what they had said in these pro Palestinian protests . And this of course does mean that we have a very heavy lid , I 'd say , on any form of protest against what 's happening in Gaza now . And if you combine that with the fact that you have a lot of firearms in circulation in the United States and mounting tension around these issues and at the same time a very strong blockade around any pro Palestinian voices or any in the United States that does create a situation where indeed there could be violence to come and other acts of the same nature due simply to frustration mounting in the country for those who are indeed against what 's carried . being carried out in Gaza now . And of course , all of this comes as there 's mounting international criticism on Israel 's policy , not just in Gaza , but also in the West Bank . That 's absolutely what we just saw the Israeli foreign minister there talk about , , linking this attack to the rhetoric of European countries , but indeed what we are seeing is mounting frustration . there 47 people who 've been killed in Gaza recording two local authorities since this morning were under Israeli bombing and raids and attacks and indeed since Israel has stated its desire and ambition to take full control of the Gaza Strip and indeed as plans to displace Palestinian people . We 're talking about 1 million Palestinian people in Libya . These are the recent ideas that are being floated by the Netanyahu administration . , , there is mounting criticism across European countries . In particular , the European Union is talking about indeed suspending its cooperation accords with the with Israel . But this also comes at a time where just yesterday there was an incident in which the Israeli army fired in the air close to diplomatic representations who are visiting the city of Janine . Janine where there has been a violent crackdown in previous months by the Israeli army who 's taken control of part of the Janine refugee camp displacing tens of thousands of Palestinian people there again in the West Bank . So we have a situation where Israelis is stepping up the violence and what Jemanuel Bah is saying is blind violence and the humanitarian blockade in the turning Gaza into death trap pressure mounting in the West Bank and indeed the EU and various countries France , Britain who are and Canada who are talking about taking what are effectively sanctions against part of Israeli interest and this of course creates I 'd say tension between the countries and of course this shooting takes place in this context with Jean Baro for example saying this morning that indeed this was a heinous act of anti - semitic violence but in the meantime there is clearly a shift in public opinion and even foreign policy when it comes to Israel 's staunchest allies James thank you for that 's 24 's James Andre ."
https://youtu.be/EEt_x-1OkWc?si=ZQFXR16shjukOWih,Gaza blockade: International pressure mounts on Israeli government ,France 24 English,EEt_x-1OkWc,"International Affairs editor Philip Tull is with me here on set . , Philip , it 's not been a particularly good week for the Israeli prime minister , has it ? But it has n't stopped him , Stuart , from taking the stage yesterday and more or less saying that he 's going to continue doing exactly what he 's been doing all the way down the line , and that is that he wants two things . First of all , to crush Hamas , and second , to get the release of the hostages . but there growing criticism there is growing criticism of the way he 's handling this crisis not only within Israel but also around the world and we 've seen an upping of the ante over the past few days certainly from the United States but also from the European Union and Canada that letter that was signed early this week by Britain , France and Canada saying that they were going to take action against Israel if it did n't stop the bombardment of the people of Gaza and the war in Gaza . we 've also seen Britain saying that it was interrupting a trade deal with Israel from immediate effect and taking out sanctions against three West Bank settlers , two illegal settler outposts and two organizations , plus this the summoning of the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom . So we 've seen a certain increase in the pressure being placed on Benjamin Netanyahu , but I think that pressure is fairly limited in the fact that it 's not going to really change very much on the ground for the Israeli president or the Israeli prime minister rather because he is pretty much determined and show has shown no willingness to change tack or change path in what he 's doing and that 's raised other concerns I think amongst western leaders . First of all , the long - term plan for Gaza , which appears to be to clean it out of all the Palestinians , if possible , that 's been turned down by the neighbors of the Gaza Strip in Israel , saying that they are not willing to take in any Palestinians , in a bid , what Donald Trump has been calling the Riviera in Gaza to build Trump towers and golf courses . but there is fear about ethnic cleansing going on there . The other point that I think people are concerned about is the fact that there is a perception that Benjamin Netanyahu is putting his own personal career ahead of his political intentions because he wants to avoid going to court on accusations of offering business contracts in return for bribes . and while he 's prime minister , he will not face any of those proceedings . And because he 's dependent on the far propping up his government , , he has to cave into what they do . And that 's why the war in Gaza is going on for so long and there 's so much hardship for the Palestinians . There are some signs , are n't there , that even Donald Trump seems to be turning his back on Netanyahu to some extent . Anyway , it was illustrated a little bit during Trump 's visit trip to the Middle East . . And I think it was noticeable to everybody that Donald Trump did n't go to see Benjamin Netanyahu when he was on that Middle East trip . for two reasons . First of all , because Donald Trump does n't see eye to eye with the Israeli prime minister on the wave dealing with Iran . Netanyahu is up in arms against Donald Trump for negotiating with the Iranians on their nuclear deal . And and secondly , because Donald Trump wants the war in Gaza over and he is tired of the continued bloodshed there . He 's made no bones about the fact he wants this war over . and done with so they can move on . That does n't seem to be happening now . Will it affect the way the US is investing in Israel ? Not for the moment , probably . And remember , the US is the biggest exporter of weapons to Israel with about 65.6 % of those weapons exported to the Isra going to interrupt you . The Israeli foreign ministers has just started speaking in English ."

Charlotte Hughes is taking the helm tonight . Charlotte , you are focusing on a rumor in the US . It 's about the Republican party . Some internet users alleging that the LGBTQ dating app is threatening to reveal the identity of every Republican politician using that app . That 's , Shar . The rumor alleges that Grinder has warned it will reveal the identity of every Republican politician who uses the app if Florida passes certain anti - LGBTQ laws . Now , this rumor has gained significant traction on a number of social media platforms , especially Tik Tok . This post , for instance , garnered more than 100,000 likes . I also found the rumor doing the rounds on Instagram , as you can see here , racking up many comments . The rumor has also spread to Facebook . Again , as you can see , more than 25,000 likes here . And finally , another platform I found the rumor circulating on is X , where this user has recirculated that claim . Now , a number of reactions to these rumors that the app is going to release all of this data . For instance , one user here on Instagram urging the app , do n't threaten , just do it . another user here alleging that Grinder is threatening I quote hypocrites in the party and that it 's this user is supporting this outing . and then finally we have another person again voicing support for this rumor and this reported threat from the app . However , fearing that Grinder may run into legal difficulties if it went through with such a move . Talk to us then , Sean , a little bit more about the rumor itself . Is there any truth to it ? So , the rumor is in fact false . that first started doing the rounds online back in 2023 when an account on X called the Halfway Post that I have here reported this alleged breaking news on its account . Now , it 's important to note that the bio of this account states that it posts comedy and satire content . And the rumor that stemmed from this post back in 2023 was debunked by AP which managed to get hold of a spokesperson from the app who very quickly denied these allegations . It 's also very important to note that no reputable news agency reported again this apparent breaking news back in 2023 and nor are they now . What is interesting to look at though is the context in which these rumors emerged . So , back in 2023 when the rumors first surfaced , it came the same day that Florida Governor Ronda Santis , who I 'm showing here , his administration proposed to widen what critics have termed the do n't say gay law to ban classroom education on sexual orientation and gender identity . Now , the rumor has of course resurfaced at a time when the Trump administration is aiming to cail the rights of LGBTQ people , Trump having ended policies including non - binary recognition and gender affirming care . Finally then , Charlotte , although these rumors are false , as you say , Grinder has in the past been at the center of a number of controversies . Tell us more . It has indeed . back in 2024 , a Wisconsin priest who was outed and lost his job after using the app . He has alleged that his data was sold without his knowledge or consent and he has filed a lawsuit against the app due to this . Three years prior to that , Grinder was fined 5.5 million pounds or 6.5 million euros for selling user data to advertisers . Now , Grinder 's current website , I took a look at their policies in terms of data protection ."
https://youtu.be/4MoxMzFAENk?si=0D24xqgfjSPE1eno,The cost of US protection: South Korea and Japan face defence payment squeeze,France 24 English,4MoxMzFAENk,"[ Music ] Just a few kilome south of the border that separates the two Koreas , soldiers are taking part in live fire drills and full - scale military exercises . Every 3 months , South Korean soldiers and their American allies train here together . With global tensions rising and increased threats from North Korea , China , and Russia , South Korea relies heavily on American military protection . Some 28,000 troops are permanently stationed in the country . Korea is a very important ally for the US in terms of everything we stand for together over here in the peninsula . But this presence comes at a cost . By 2026 , Seoul will have to pay nearly€1 billion for this American support . Before becoming president , Donald Trump had threatened to multiply that bill 10fold . If I were there now , they 'd be paying us $ 10 billion a year . And what ? They 'd be happy to do it . It 's a money machine . South Korea , American support comes with a hefty price tag because South Korea hosts more than 70 US military installations . The country is also home to the largest US base overseas , Camp Humphrey 's . It 's a real city spanning around 14 square kilometers , where American soldiers even train young Koreans . 1 2 moving . You 're in position of attention . In South Korea , military service is still mandatory . And each year , nearly 2,000 young men are selected to complete theirs at a US base in the country . 1 2 3 . This training program called KATUSA brings the two armies together and has passed on American expertise for 74 years . Hips go forward . The more you enact your hips , the higher the weight goes . Here , nothing is left to chance . Whether in physical training , classes , or even room inspections . No longer . It is . See this ? Do you want mold ? , sir . All . , then dry it off . , sir . Serious . Got it . Running shoes . It seems a small thing , ? But small things on the battlefield can result in life and death . . , sir . In South Korea , the cost of this American support is a sensitive issue . But this Korean instructor says he 's proud to work alongside American troops . the importance of the joint operation emerging . So the kuzas now they 're going to be the key point . If we do n't have a system this all the joint operations between the US and Iraq forces can not be the success . But not everyone agrees the American military presence and its massive cost worries some South Koreans . These pacifists do n't see it as a protection but rather a risk . In Soul , this association has campaigned for 30 years for the region 's disarmament . The Korean Peninsula is already in a state of permanent nuclear confrontation , but joint military exercises between the US and South Korea risk worsening this confrontation even more by pushing North Korea to further strengthen its nuclear stance . That is why we demand an end to these exercises to restore peace in the region . South Korea is not the only overseas ally for the United States in this region . Japan also pays for American protection on its soil . About€ 1.3 billion per year for nearly 50,000 soldiers stationed across the country . However , President Trump considers that amount too low . But according to this Japanese expert , it 's unthinkable for the American troops to leave because US presence in Japan is too important for both countries . Faced with the risks from North Korea or China , it remains essential for Japan and the United States to continue their cooperation . It 's precisely because the US values its alliances that is asking Japan and even other allies to enhance their military capabilities . In addition to the tens of thousands of soldiers posted in Asia , Trump is pushing his allies to strengthen their own armies . Japan 's defense budget has just reached a new record , 53 billion e for 2025 . That 's an increase of 70 % in just 3 years . And Japan is going even further to avoid sole dependence on the US . Last November , Tokyo signed a new defense treaty with the European Union ."
https://youtu.be/XBa1IN33Phk?si=npxMBkeqcmrONlr_,South Africa's Ramaphosa set to meet Trump amid tensions over 'genocide' claim,France 24 English,XBa1IN33Phk,"Donald Trump meanwhile is hosting his South African counterpart at the White House today . That meeting with Sarel Ramaposa could be a tense one though after Trump accused South Africa of being racist against white people and allowing a genocide to take place against minority white farmers . South Africa now has rejected that claim and is hoping to reset relations with this trip . Our Fraser Jackson 's covering the story for us in Washington and he joins me now live from there . Fraser , good morning to you . What more can you tell us about this meeting today ? , South African president Sil Ramaposa was one of the chief negotiators in talks to end apartheid in the 1990s and once again he 's going to need his skills and charm if he 's to woo Donald Trump at the White House this Wednesday . Ramapos are looking for a reset in relations between Washington and Ptoria after months of heated rhetoric and actions even between the world 's biggest economy and Africa 's biggest economy . Ramaposa will be looking to speak Trump 's language , a focus really on trade . Now , in 2024 , over $ 20 billion dollar worth of trade flow between the two countries , but only about a quarter of that was sold by the US . Trump 's fixation on balancing trade relationships means that South Africa will likely present opportunities for the US to sell more to the African nation . But a White House official says that Donald Trump is planning on taking issue with some domestic equality laws as well . For example , under South African law , larger businesses must be 30 % owned by disadvantaged groups . That includes black South Africans and Trump will be pushing for an exemption for US companies . Something that could prove tricky for Ramiposa to sell back home . In a similar vein , Trump will also likely raise what the administration 's called the prosecution , the persecution rather of Africanas , the group who are descendants of early Dutch and French settlers . Trump has repeatedly and it should be said without evidence as well said that Africanas are being killed as part of a genocide claims that South Africa refutes . but ultimately if all else fails the 72 - year - old president of South Africa can also rely on a love that he and Donald Trump both have in common . That of course being golf . Ramaposa has already invited President Trump to play a few holes at the G20 summit that 's going to take place in South Africa later this year . Fraser , despite the Gulf , it does seems there are going to be some sticking points in these talks today . How likely is it that things will go well for the South Africans on this trip to Washington ? I think it really depends on what the key focus and these discussions ends up being . I said , the South Africans will be keen to mainly focus on trade and reentering the relationship with the US around that . But if things end up going south , it 'll likely be because discussions centered around the perceived persecution of the white Africanas . Trump is already upset with South Africa because of the genocide case that it lodged against Israel at the International Court of Justice . But his focus now is seems to be on what he calls the plight of the Africanas . That 's also something that 's been fueled by his friend Elon Musk who of course himself is a white South African . South Africa 's recent implication of a law as well which allows the uncompensated seizing of land when deemed equitable and in the public interest has drawn criticism from the Trump administration that even prompted the US to welcome scores of white African as refugees escaping racial discrimination just last week . Trump 's allegations of a genocide it should be said however are unfounded when you look at the statistics . The murders of white farmers , for example , can be extremely gruesome in South Africa . But in total , they make up about just a quarter of a percent of the roughly 20,000 murders that take place in South Africa every year . But of course , this is an issue which is tied up in South Africa 's racist history and even pulls up the very social fabric of the country . So we 'll see how Ramaposa handles those kinds of comments from Donald Trump . I think if Trump wants to give him a dressing down then we could witness something more akin to the way in which Zalinski 's meeting with Trump went . but if others before him Ramaposa can flatter Trump and subtly correct him on the facts then we may end up seeing the reset of relations that the South Africans are looking for . pray ."

Mark , what details do we have about what could be in this so - called measured response from the French government ? , that 's being discussed as we speak since 11:30 Paris time . There is a special meeting so - called security and defense council convened by the president at the Eliz palace . Normally , it 's to discuss about mainly military issues and so on , but there have been such meeting during the co And we are told that there would be some announcements made after this meeting about certain measures and others that might be classified and therefore not announced . What could happen is that some schools or some sporting associations or some community associations could be banned . Some people could be targeted by the justice system or we could have fines that some would have to pay . It 's difficult to imagine an outright ban of the Muslim Brotherhood first of all because it does n't exist as such in France . There are some Muslim organizations that could be banned but we 're seeing the national rally . It 's President Jordan Vardella again this morning calling for a ban . Why ? Because the organization is banned in several countries in several Muslim countries . U lately in Jordan for example this has been decided . It 's difficult to see it happening here in France because obviously this is an extremely controversial and sensitive issues because many Muslim organizations are saying this is dangerous because you 're scapegoating and portraying the Muslim community in general as being against the French state against the fabric of society and it 's there is a need to really to be cautious to look at the issue and not avoid it but also to take careful and well thoughtout measures and that 's not always been the case in the past . . And it was the French president himself who decided to convene this special meeting today . It is a hot button issue here in France . But why this top level security meeting not just a regular cabinet meeting ? That 's a good question . It 's about the message because this is a report that had been asked for by the previous interior minister Ja Darmana a year ago . it was now declassified by his successor Bruno who has his own political ambitions . He was just elected at the head of the conservative camp . But the president wanted to say this is an issue I 'm looking into also because there has been criticism in the past that Emmanuel Mron on this issue of Islam of religion had been looking the other way according to those especially on the and the far obviously are saying Emanuel M did n't really want to talk about this he said this is a sensitive issue we have the largest Muslim the largest Jewish community in France there is a war in Gaza that 's raging and making matters worse and this has also been talked about in this report . So we should try to calm tampers down and so by convening this meeting let it be known that there 's going to be a discussion defense meeting about this issue . He 's conveying the notion that it 's not only an issue any other issues purchasing power , inflation or the environment but that is a national security issue . So he clearly wants to convey the message that it 's going to be addressed in proper ways . We 'll have to see whether this will have the results because there is a law that was passed now nearly four years ago against separatism . Many of the measures that we 're likely to see announced today are already in this law , but as is the case , often those laws are voted , not really implemented , and before there can be real assessment , something comes up . There 's a need for more actions . So , we 'll have to see if it 's a lot about talk or if there will be concrete measures that can maybe address the issue and not look around it . All , Mark , thank you for that . We 'll be checking back in with you throughout the day to see how that story develops . French politics editor Mark Proman ."
https://youtu.be/S-TtIylsSqE?si=W1SOpoSj3fqy_myH,Rethinking management of natural resources: Filtration of bottled water just the tip of the iceberg,France 24 English,S-TtIylsSqE,", to get a greater insight on all of that , we can speak now to professor at the faculty of biology and medicine at the University of Lausan , Davidler . Thanks for your time . Could I start simply by asking you any health risk to what Nestle was doing ? , good morning everybody . So , , not really . The the Nestle scandal is mainly a regulatory complaint issue . So , not a public health crisis . There are no risk for the consumers . . So reassuring people were perhaps spending hundreds of percentage more for what they thought was cleaner bottled water or less contaminated bottled water than the tap water but it was more about the money . But which do you think is better for us overall then bottled water or tap water ? Depends on the quality of the tap water mainly . the first choice must be the tap water mainly for ecological reason . then if the quality of the water is too bad for sure you need to go on the bottle water and in this case paradoxically the filtration process enhance water safety offering additional protection to the consumer . So from a health perspective this measure they just increase the safety is really a matter of trust and transparence in the market . Indeed , we heard in that report one woman saying she would now trust tap water more . Do you think at least across Europe perhaps we should we could allow that ? there have been scandals in water supplies as well across the continent . So in general tap water is controlled and the results of these controls are public . So in terms of trust you can normally easily have information about the tap water you receive at home . In this sense there is more transparencies compared to bottled water and we also need to consider that finding truly uncontaminated water source is now increasingly difficult to the human activity . So in the future probably we need to deal with this treatment . Indeed and that brings into the question the very idea of having bottled water in the first place . is that not adding to the problem of our water supplies and their quality ? , exactly . So , in terms of water quality , there are no impact in this sense and it 's a matter of deal between our let 's say quality of life . We we use a lot of chemicals to for our life , for agriculture , for industry and now we also have an heritage from the past , a lot of pollutant coming from the past . And we also need to consider that today we have analytical methods much more sensitive than in the past . So we can also identify compounds that we do n't see before . This explain this issue and in the future we really need to consider that we increase the discussion about this and probably filtration must become necessary for the majority of the water in bottle indeed . And our use maybe of plastic bottles needs to reduce . But you mentioned the environmental impacts and we are seeing so much our environment change . We 're seeing more droughts for example . that 's obviously going to have an impact on the water tables and what is available to both companies and countries . Where do you think see things headed there ? , this is the main issue now as is not related to the water bottle only is impact all the food chain from agriculture to water . So we need to understand that our life has an impact in natural resources and more and more . So we also have this heavy let 's say chronic pollution from the past is we are not in the main pollution era of humanity in the last 50 years . so this of scandal must now discuss from a in a larger perspective meaning how we want to have incontaminated resource versus our quality of life and our impact in the nature and I guess it also begs the question of who should manage our water resources . Exactly . . So in there are some solution to protect some areas and also why not to just leave time to clean this areas because a lot of pollutant they are present in water because they are used and but if we do n't touch let 's say this area for several years we can evacuate these pollutants . So in term of management of resource we really need to think larger than only the issue of filtration of bottled water . And could a future finally where we have companies and countries fighting for water resources ? For sure . I think this will be a major issue also due to the climate change in which we already saw last year and the year before . a difficulties to have water from natural sources in this time . The the quality of water must be in the future also an economic value increasing the need of treatment but also the value of the economic value of tour which probably push authorities to increase the regulatory about the protection of natural resources . David Stadler of University of Lausan thanks so much for joining us and giving us your time here on France 24 . Very much appreciated ."

Food , water , and electricity are scarce . It 's extremely difficult to get water . There are days when you have some and then the next 10 days you have nothing . Our life is nothing but suffering . In her spare time , Shima gives her son math , Arabic , and English lessons . Very good . He 's been out of school for more than a year now . My dream is to go to school all the other children in the world and learn . Their suffering is also aggravated by the absence of a husband and father . TK Abusada left his family in April as part of a refugee aid program in France . He now resides in Tulus where he is studying . When the internet returns to the camp , she tries to call her husband . . 3,000 km away , TK finally picks up . She tells him how she struggles every day . Who 's daddy 's love ? , the little one cries all day because the bombings terrorize him . And when the shooting starts at night , he wakes up and screams , "" Daddy , daddy . "" And he 's always hungry . how he loves food , especially meat . He 's suffering all day long , and we 're not . do n't abandon us . See , Nana being so far away from his family is difficult for TK who is alone in France . He hides his pain behind a smile . I 'd prefer to be here for them to be here within a second , but I know it will take some time . , it 's understandable . I hope they 'll be here soon . A few days ago , Trick started preparing his PhD in law at the University of Tulus . Before the war , he was a promising young lawyer in Gaza City . The situation there is catastrophic . So hopefully during my studies in France , something good will happen . a better future could be built . Trick is one of 115 Palestinians welcomed by France as part of a refugee program .

I always tell my children that their date of birth is the day we arrived in France . We think a lot about our family who are still over there . But that 's life . You have to keep going . Muhammad was welcomed as a research professor at the University of Straburg . My office is over there on the third floor . For two years , we were doing nothing , just living in a tent . But now the tent has really grown . It 's no longer a tent . It 's Strasburg , a big city . But the war is never far away . Muhammad shows one of the last videos of him giving a lecture in Gaza . My students and I were there sitting quietly . Two of them died in a bombing raid . A few days later , the university was targeted and partially destroyed . It hurts too much to see these images , see my books , the library . Our history destroyed this . In the middle of our conversation , an airplane flies overhead . Muhammad has to stop the interview . That sound frightens me . The noise of the plane . , the noise from the plane is a problem for us . My seven - year - old asked me , "" What is that ? is it going to bomb us ? And I tell him , "" , it 's safe here . Everything 's fine . "" Trauma to heal and a whole life to rebuild . The next step for Muhammad is to get his children into school . And in Tulus , Trick has finalized the requirements to bring his sons and wife to France as quickly as possible ."
https://youtu.be/K-2Nj5vQOZU?si=IZIl-XRODA_PRlMZ,South Africa’s leader aims to salvage relationship with Trump in USA visit,France 24 English,K-2Nj5vQOZU,"Now , the US President Donald Trump is to host South Africa 's leader at the White House today for a meeting that could will be tense after Trump accused the country 's government of being racist and white pe against white people and allowing a genocide to take place against minority white farmers . Now , South Africa has strongly rejected those allegations . President Simul Ramaposa pushing for that meeting with Trump , an attempt to salvage his country 's relationship with the US . , we 're going to cross live to Cape Town . talk to our correspondent Tom Kennedy who joins us from there . Tom , he 's got his work cut out for him , has n't he , Savoser , after the language that we 've heard over the last few months . He certainly does and there 's nothing more reflective of how difficult things will be for Ramiposa than the timing of these 49 white South African so - called refugees who arrived in the US last week over what Donald Trump has called a genocide against white people . What he 's referring to there is farm attacks and crime in rural areas which statistically show that affects black people far more than the white population here . Trump has also hiked tariffs against South Africa since taking office and that 's what samaposa has said is his priority with this meeting to normalize relations between the two countries and get trade back on track . So what might make Donald Trump then come round do you think ? So many people are worried that S Ramaposa could be walking into another Vomimir Zalinski style embarrassment at the White House here . It seems that the US wants a shift in foreign and domestic policy in South Africa . In terms of foreign policy , the Trump administration has put pressure on South Africa to withdraw its case against Israel at the ICJ . And in terms of domestic policy , figures Elon Musk have been vocal critics of the South African government for its black economic empowerment laws , which he said is the reason one of the main reasons why he has n't brought Starlink to his home country South Africa . But many South Africans who I 've spoken to here have said that considering the country 's history , they want their president to stay strong on these positions , these issues domestically and in terms of foreign policy . they say it 's their moral responsibility in terms of the delegation that Ramiposa has brought with him . he 's he 's chosen to bring John Steinhusen , the leader of the Democratic Alliance , which is the former opposition party to the ANC and now the biggest partner in the government of national unity . So some people are saying that 's a good call in terms of trying to appease Donald Trump and on that note is even brought with is included in this delegation two former professional golfers . So now it 's up to Ramiposa and his team to try to fight against disinformation which has been spread about South Africa with the truth all while trying to appease a US president who is not afraid to clash heads with foreign leaders . Tom , thanks very much . Tom Kenny , a correspondent to joining us"
https://youtu.be/vISOr8QFLfM?si=hZzr-_KMC_iyCZQ4,Gaza blockade: United Nations says no aid has been distributed in Gaza,France 24 English,vISOr8QFLfM,", let 's cross then straight to Jerusalem . Talk to our correspondent Noga Tonapolski who joins us from Noga , bring us up to date . , first of all , so far this aid still not getting through . Apparently , not yet getting through . From the best of my ability to understand , there is no mechanism in place now to transfer any of this aid to the people who need it . there 's simply no method , no practical structure in place . In addition , by the Israeli army 's own numbers in the first two days since Prime Minister Netanyahu announced the resumption of aid , approximately 100 trucks of aid have entered Gaza . in order to even begin to satisfy the needs of two million people in Gaza who have been under siege and with no assistance , no medical or nutritional assistance for two months , you need something six or 700 trucks a day . And so there is a danger that what we 're seeing now is a bit of a performative resumption of aid and nothing that could have an effect on the ground . Meanwhile , , Noga , pressure is mounting on the Israeli government as well . Even an Israeli opposition leader has hit out at the country 's government over its approach to the war in Gaza . His latest comments after he earlier accused the government on the radio of killing babies as a hobby and said Israel was becoming an outcast among nations . Let 's hear his clarification of that point . I said this morning that we are a sane country that does not kill children . When ministers in this government celebrate the death and starvation of children , we must say so . I was referring solely to the most failed government in Israeli history , not to the IDF . Our mission is to ensure that Israel remains a sane country that does not kill children either as a hobby or as a policy . , let 's go back to Noatanapolski in Jerusalem . , the pressure is being kept up , is n't it ? Still building . The pressure is mounting almost minute by minute in fact . But General Yaer Golan , the head of the Democrats party , what used to be the Labor Party of Israel was interesting because what he said , his comments really were directed at Prime Minister 's ministers , many of whom have no ministerial experience and who Prime Minister who brought to join his coalition from the fringiest extremes of Israeli society . and they in fact are the people putting Israel in danger with the international legal authorities and making very murky what Israel 's actual plans are because if you listen to some ministers it does sound Israel is trying to starve the finance minister for example it sounds Israel is trying to simply starve and deport all of the Gazins now that is of course not official government policy but the prime minister has n't reprimanded ed those of his ministers who spoke in that way and that is the background to these very harsh comments by this opposition leader who said a sane country does n't talk about killing babies for sport and that is part of the confusion that has simply blanketed Israel in the last few days as Israelis are not informed by their government what 's really going on what the strategic plan is or if there is any endgame for the Gaza Four . ."

Yuka Roy joins us here in the studio . Very good evening to you . Now , Monday saw Emanuel Macron beaming at his flagship business summit which attracted 20 billion euros in new investments . Among them , a massive order for well , massive ships . Massive ships . , one of Europe 's largest cruise operators , MSC , signed a deal to build two new ships at France 's San Shipyard to the tune of three and a half billion euros . The French Minister for Industry and Energy said the partnership would help revive the country 's ship building industry even though cruise ships often draw criticism over their environmental impact . Luke Shrego and our colleagues at Fizang have more . It 's quite the contract for French ship builder Shantier de Ladlique . Two worldclass cruise liners this one still under construction . The vessels will ultimately be 233 m in length , take 9,000 people on board , and keep the company busy at least until 2030 . It 's a huge order , some 3.5 billion euros for Shantik , and good news for our workloads . The new cruise ships will count for 20 million work hours and 3,000 guaranteed jobs over four years . For this manager , it 's a vote of confidence in French expertise . Beyond the technical nature of what we design , build and deliver , there 's the craftsmanship and layout . That know - how is unique in Europe and France . There are four shipyards in Europe that know how to build cruise liners . Francis Shotti Leontique is doing quite well since we 've been delivering all our products on time and on budget to the satisfaction of our customers for quite some time now . 60 % of the equipment on board is made in France , meaning work for 500 companies . One of them handles insulation , and staff see it as a breath of fresh air . All of this is around 900,000 m of insulation . now , it stands for peace of mind at a point which is pretty hard for the industry . Despite liquid natural gas powered engines , there 's been criticism over their methane byproduct . And Shantier Deatlantique is currently testing systems designed to limit their polluting emissions . The size of the boat compared to the turbo , compared to the transit van , compared to the They 're enormous , are n't they ? Anyway , I 'll be quiet . Let 's get on to the markets . Yuka . , Asian and European stocks rose this Tuesday after China 's central bank lowered interest rates to historic lows . London 's Footsie 100 rose almost 1 % . Paris 's cat gyand up three quarters of a percentage point and Fruit Stacks finished above 24,000 points for the first time . Wall Street though is in the red as volatility returned to the markets amid efforts by Donald Trump to pass his massive spending bill through Congress . He personally went to Capitol Hill earlier this Tuesday . Opponents warn it could add $ 3.3 trillion to the US deficit over the next decade . Now , you could tell me that one company enjoyed a stellar market debut in Hong Kong . That 's the Chinese EV battery maker CL . It rose 16 % and raised 4.6 billion in the world 's biggest IPO initial public offering so far this year . In less than 15 years , the company has become a top battery supplier for electric cars . It hopes the Hong Kong listing in addition to existing stock market trade in mainland China will help expand its global footprint . The company has said that it will use these funds to f to build a factory in Hungary which will supply batteries for car makers BMW , Stalantis and Volkswagen . This would be the group 's second plant in Europe after one was opened in Germany in 2023 . CLTL last year had a market share of almost 38 % in the global automobile EV batteries . Meanwhile , Japan 's Honda scales back its investment in electric cars . Honda says it will spend 43 billion euros on developing EVs and related software by 2030 , down from the previously announced 61 billion . The 30 % reduction in investment comes amid slowing global demand for electric cars . And as governments around the world ease timelines to meet emissions target , Donald Trump 's efforts to curb environmental regulation was also reflected in the decision . Honda says it will instead focus on developing more hybrid model models for now , although it still plans to make all of its cars electric by 2040 mark . , , finally for business , can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street ? , via Netflix . At least starting later this year , the streaming giant has struck a deal with Sesame Workshop to show the 56th season in a new format as well as 90 hours of previous episodes on its platform . It comes after the future of the iconic show was threatened by a recent decision by Donald Trump to pull funding from the public broadcaster PBS , the longtime home of Sesame characters since 1969 . As well as on Netflix , the show will also continue to air on the channel . Warner Brothers Discovery , which had aired Sesame Street since 2016 , last year decided not to renew its deal for new episodes . Here 's Cookie Monster giving a little preview . , here we go . Coming soon . Cookie Monster . My favorite . , Oscar the Groud . She 's another one that I really liked as well . And Ernie and Big Bird . Bert and Ernie . They 're the ones , are n't they ? Yuka Roya there with the business . Fantastic stuff . More from Yuka , of course , as we go through the evening . The business never stops here on France 24 . Thank you very much . That made me laugh , that one completely . ,"

Among the first to celebrate was French President Emanuel Mron . Despite numerous attempts to manipulate them , the Romanian people have chosen democracy , rule of law , and the European Union . France has a real interest in Romania 's geopolitical future as it leads NATO 's eastern flank stationed in Romania , deploying thousands of French troops and dozens of armored vehicles to the country since February 2022 for military drills in the event that a conflict breaks out between Russia and a NATO ally . The far- candidate George Simeon accused Paris of meddling in Romania 's elections . Notably , a video call between President Mackerel and Nicaras Sordan discussing corporation postelection victory just 2 days before the Romanians cast their votes . Neighbor Moldova , which held a similarly tense election in November 2024 , but came through with a pro - EU president , was also quick to congratulate the Bucharest mayor . Muldova and Romania stand together , supporting one another and working side by side for a peaceful , democratic , and European future for all of our citizens . Germany 's president , the Polish and Spanish prime ministers , as well as the EU Commission president also reacted positively to the news . The Kremlin , however , inquired on Monday about the election process , stating that the votes conduct had been strange to say the least . inside Romania . The results were received with both optimism and apprehension . I feel very good . I feel relieved . I 'm glad that we can continue our European path . I feel bad because Nicasur Dan is president . First of all , he 's not even capable . I have n't looked into it , but , he 's not even capable of running Bucharest , let alone the country .

https://youtu.be/INXmCe9IUDg?si=nPV3AvlTnsLUefsC,This is the end'?: Stolen bust of Jim Morrison finally found •,France 24 English,INXmCe9IUDg,"Here in France , the carved bus that adorned Jim Morrison 's grave has been located . French police say it was missing for nearly 40 years . So , this discovery has many fans with the doors elated that the stolen sculpture has been found . To get all the details on this story , let 's bring in France 24 's Solange Mans . First of all , how did the police find the bust ? , according to Paris 's anti - fraud department , it was a chance discovery . That 's what they 're calling it . On Monday , they announced on social media that they 'd been doing a search in regard to a different case , a fraud investigation , and that they came across the white marble bust of Jim Morrison , which had been missing from his grave for 37 years . And since there has been this mystery for so long , what happened to the stolen statue ? , the French police did a bit of a tease on Instagram saying , "" Get for at first , guess what we found . "" And then in the following slide , they unveiled the graffitied sculpture , which now of course has police tags and tape on it . But beyond those strings that there and the and the red seals , the bust looks it did in 1988 . its nose and part of its mouth are still chipped off . It 's thought that those breaks were done at the time by souvenir hunters . And as we 're about to hear , it 's thought that it was a diehard Doors fan that took it , but we do n't exactly know who stole the statue all those years ago on May 9th , 1988 . It was a mega fan of the Doors who came to Perles one night , broke off the bust , and then attached it to a moped scooter and sped through the cemetery at the crazy speed of 70 km hour . It was completely out of this world . It 's crazy . All . Now , the sculpture has been found , but there just still remains some mystery about it . , police have yet to tell us where it has been all these years or if they 're digging further into its disappearance now that it 's been found . They did tell the French paper liber that the bus was found along with a Warhol painting and some Rolexes in this fraud case . The head of Pelles cemetery where Morrison is buried . He told the French paper Lufigu that he has not been contacted by police over whether the marble statue will be given back to the cemetery , but he did say that Jim Morrison 's family that they wanted it there . he said that Jim Morrison 's grave is for Peshas akin to the Mona Lisa for the Louv . and when you visit the cemetery in the 20th , you really do feel the continued Morrison mania . There are markings and etchings that read Jim this way with an arrow on other tombs and signs . there are flowers and lighters and wine and many tourists and doors fans mulling about . sometimes you even see people crying over Jim Morrison 's grave over a half a century later . the rock icon died in Paris in 1971 . There was never an autopsy and there are continued rumors about his death . early accounts say that he died in a bath bathtub of cardiac arrest . Others say that it was a heroin overdose in a club . There 's even a fake theory about the age that he died . He died at age 27 . There 's no debate about that . But a number of other musicians including Bri Brian Jones , Jimmy Hendris , Janice Joplin , Kurt Cobain , Amy White House , they died at 272 and they are called today the 27 Club . Now , I called this a false theory because it is untrue that there is more of a chance to die at 27 when you are a rock star . A study by the British Medical Journal , they found that there is no scientific basis in this phenomenon or coincidence . But it did find that fame may increase the risk of death among musicians , but that this risk is not limited to the age of 27 . In any case , this marble bus was not part of the original tombstone for Jim Morrison when he was buried . , it was n't . it was designed by the Croatian artist Madan Michelin . it was added for the 10th anniversary of Morrison 's death in 1981 . he died in 1971 . And the Morrison estate has now said that they are very happy of its return . Again , his family wanted it to be there . Now we 'll see if it 's reattached . It is possible that this is hypothesis , but it is possible that Pes will choose not to do that to try and keep crowds and graffiti down . already there is added security for his grave but also for other graves Edith Piaf Shopan Sarah Burnernheart Alan Cardc the founder of spiritism who has a huge following from South from Latin America people bring flowers to his grave others used to kiss Oscar Wild 's grave in Pes but the kisses were hurting the stone so that ceased . there is a very long list of famous tombs at Pelves which is ironic because initially Parisians they snubbed the cemetery for being too far outside of the city 's limits . No one wanted to be buried there in the early 1800s . And so to draw people administrators they created a marketing campaign and they move they moved the tombs of Molier and Jean Le Fonten and then the starcross lovers Abel and Eloise which paved the way for Pes to be the place to be buried with now Jim Morrison 's grave bust or no bust being one of the main draws of what is now the world 's most visited cemetery . And it might seem strange , but it really is one of the coolest things to check out in Paris . Thank you so much for that . And now perhaps we can see Jim Morrison 's bust back in its original place . Salange man , thank you so much for that . All , we 're going"
https://youtu.be/thct_T-maE8?si=p4nRM9B2xhZkgpOZ,Africa's healthcare faces crisis after Trump's aid cuts ,France 24 English,thct_T-maE8,"I 'm joined now by Dr. Doris Macharia who is the head of the Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation , its first African chief . doc doctor , thank you so much for making time to speak to us . Now you 're at the WH assembly and even amidst concerns about the effects of all of these funding cuts , you remain quite hopeful . Why is that ? , thank you for having me . I remain hopeful because as I 'm here at the W at the World Health Assembly , I 'm reminded that we are , , at really at a time when we 're going to adopt the pandemic agreement and that really talks of an international collaboration and this gives me hope in terms of the work we 've been doing for more than three decades . and even for the last two decades with the PEP for funding we 've seen tremendous gains in terms of over 20 million lives that have been saved and more than 8 million children who live who are born without HIV and that really gives me hope in terms of how we can forge collaboration and how we can forge new partnerships be able to show up new resources to enable us reach the last mile to enable us at least does egg puff think about how we can have an AIDS - free generation but more widely across the development aid landscape . Do you think that in the long term something has shifted in terms of the models used when it comes to fun to raising funds to address health issues in particularly developing countries ? Definitely definitely something has shifted for example as Eggpath we 've been working in Lutu and been have been collaborating there with the Lutu Ministry of Health since 2004 and this particular terminations which were very unfortunate resulted in about four out of the 10 districts that we are working handinhand with the Ministry of Health without any support for HIV and TB treatment and that meant about 120,000 people without any treatment for HIV and TB and laying off of 400 frontline workers . So that 's quite significant . But I think there 's some good news here . We 've seen the Lutu Ministry of Health stepping up , being able to absorb a lot of the staff members in the four affected districts , but also be able to accelerate transision of treatment in a decentralized fashion . However , they do need support . We can not let them down and we are committed to being here for the long haul to ensure that we can continue investing in child health , continue investing in making sure that we can reach our 2030 commitment of having of ending pediatric HIV . So you 're committed but how has the work that you 're doing fared amidst this crisis of funding support ? , it 's really been a difficult time . we had we have programs in Tanzania in Esotini and Lutu . and there was a lot of back and forth in terms of posing some of the activities and terminations of our esotini and lutu work and that was very unfortunate and what we 've had to do is to be able to double down ensure that we can continue the work that we 're doing work with the ministries of health but we 're also here at the world health assembly to forge new partnerships to also explore ways in which funders can also increase their contrib contributions to also bring forward some of their future contributions to now to not only fill the gap but also not to lose what we 've gained over the last two decades especially with regards to the HIV program . So we remain hopeful and as an organization we had to pivot but we remain hopeful that I with just the support and the and the partnerships we 've forged I think and the greater investment we can realize our mission of ending pediatric HIV . Thank you so much Dr. Macharia for your time and the work that you do . Dr. Dor Dr. Doris Macharia there , the head of the Elizabeth Glazer Pediatric AIDS Foundation ."
https://youtu.be/Sp20dYfggpM?si=LFin69a3OwVGf8Ew,Gaza: International pressure mounts in Israel,France 24 English,Sp20dYfggpM,"more about this with Angela Diffy who joins me on the set . Angela , we just heard John Noba there talking about reassessing these ties between Israel and the EU . There 's also been a joint statement from France , the UK and Canada threatening concrete steps . What concretely can they do ? It is worth mentioning that statement the language was really quite strong . They made very clear that they are supporters of Israel 's to defend itself , but they said that Israel 's response at the moment is wholly disproportionate . That is quite a step up from what those countries have been saying until now . In terms of what they can concretely do . they the idea of restricting weapons is would not make a great deal of difference . Only the United States supplies a significant amount of weaponry to Israel and only that would make a real difference . the other area where they might make a concrete step is on the recognition of the state of Palestine . Now Emanuel Mechon is France is hosting with Saudi Arabia a conference in New York in June and he 's already said he would not be averse to recognizing the state of Palestine . He has attached a number of conditions to that . In any case , 148 countries already do recognize the state of Palestine . It 's highly symbolic but makes no impact in terms of the reality at the moment . So on the one hand it 's a step up . It 's symbolic but it would not significantly impact anything . The other area where there could be a real difference is on trade and excuse me we heard Jeanuel Baru there talking about this Netherlands initiative . trade between Israel and the EU is governed by an agreement . the EU is Israel 's biggest trade partner . So that could make a difference . The issue there is that the EU is very divided on this . Ireland , Spain , Slovenia very pro Palestinian on these issues . Germany , Hungary , Austria , they are very reluctant to do anything stronger . I suspect because Trump has said not on my watch . I suspect that Netanyahu will move to make sure that this humanitarian aid is speeded up and more effective very quickly . So , how is Israel reacting to all of these different statements from around the world ? . , as I say , I think they will because Trump has said very clearly , I do not want dying children on my watch . , they probably will try to sort out whatever is holding everything up . beyond that Netanyahu has said very clearly this war could end tomorrow if Hamas returned the 58 hostages and if they disarmed . He has also said recognizing the state of Palestine would be a very fine reward for the genocidal attack he said on September on October the 7th . So he 's come out very strongly against this European and UK Canada these words from all of those countries . beyond that the military initiative because they 're all saying can you pull back the military offensive and can you step up humanitarian aid the military offensive a lot of people are saying look we 've done this we 've been here before they already ordered the evacuation of Kunis in the south that happened in 2024 why is it happening all over again why did n't it work the first time the Israelis say we are trying to establish control of Gaza completely so that we can stop aid being stolen by Hamas The aid agencies say some of it probably is stolen , but that is negligible compared to the usefulness of getting it to people and that you can not give aid with the conditions attached and the screening attached that the Israelis are proposing . They say we 're trying to establish control to set up this new system of giving aid and in the meantime we 'll let aid in under the old system . Angela , thank you for that .

She blames the conservative president of the Valenthia region for the disaster that killed her father and 227 other people . We met her the day Carlos Mason hosted the European People 's Party in his city in a venue that is still traumatizing to [ Music ] victims . This is the Valencia Conference Center where our dead were brought . people who were killed by their negligence because they did n't warn us in the days before or even on the day of the danger we faced . To demand accountability , Rossa has created an association of 150 victims of the floods . Their headquarters , the home of her father , Manuel , where they found him dead , trapped by the rising water . My father died just here . The water level rose to 2 m 50 as you can see here . I ca n't even reach that level with my hand . My father did n't drown . He died because the mud obstructed his airways . Rosa believes Manuel 's death could have been avoided . She has filed legal charges against Carlos Mathon and four top officials in the region . This is the document where all the civil parties to the suit me have signed . These were involuntary manslaughters . We need to send those responsible to jail . I 'm not going to give up working for that while my life and health allows . So far , the investigating magistrate has only questioned the regional government 's justice minister and her deputy . It could take the justice system several years to bring any prosecutions . frustratingly long for devastated communities along the banks of the Puyo ravine . In Horse 's business , the sound of sewing machines has stopped . He barely comes back to the place which was once the largest manufacturer of traditional costumes in the region . The employees used to sit here , at least one person to every machine . I wanted my children to take over the business and that was n't possible . My son died locking the door . Jose lost everything . 6 months after the tragedy , he has n't received any funds from the state or the region . His insurance has only paid him 10 % of his damages , € 200,000 . He estimates his losses at over4 [ Music ] million . I have n't been able to carry on with my business . The only way I could get any money was to sell all my stock because otherwise I could n't pay my bills . In the area affected by the floods , the state has paid out a little less than a third of the 16.6 billion promised . The region has dealt with half the claims made . Given the pace of the authorities , the help of volunteers is indispensable . Teresa fills up the shopping cart of 79year - old Anna every week . You can put anything you want in there . Tomato sauce , vegetable salad . Every week we distribute all the products here . The idea is that this lady can save money to put it towards repairing her house . This beneficiary of food aid lived in a ground floor flat . She has only received € 6,000 from the regional government . My home was destroyed by the mud . My neighbor saved me just in time . I still have n't got a coffee table , a dining room table , so I need to rely on volunteers . In this town where 56 people died , the residents are doing their best to go on with their lives . Today , after six months spent at another school , Livia , Natalia , and Matus are finally going to be able to meet up with their friends again . A huge relief for their mother . I 'm so happy to see that . I hope that everything can go back to normal . A hope that is shared by the residents of the towns devastated by a disaster that will scar them forever ."
https://youtu.be/A0wcC7-jMZc?si=5LTRCCKbJmDl08r22,"No, China did not violate Israel’s aid blockade",France 24 English,A0wcC7-jMZc,"Up next , it 's time for Truth or Fake . Catalina Maranda Abru is here in studio . Catalina , in tonight 's edition , we 're returning to our top story , the humanitarian crisis in Gaza . So , did China conduct humanitarian air drops there despite the Israeli air blockade that 's been in place for nearly three months now ? Tell us more . , aid deliveries are set to resume in Gaza today as Israel ends its two - monthl long a block of the strip . The UN says that 20 trucks are set to enter Gaza today where Gazins face an increased risk of famine . All the while users were sharing this throughout the month of May , claiming that China is the only country helping Gaza in violation of this Israeli blockade . Here 's one example . This user says , "" While the EU continues to send weapons to the Zionist government of Israel , China parachutes food and medicine over Gaza . "" While this other user shares the same images , but in a video version and writes , "" While Western countries supply bombs to Israel , the Chinese sent food and medicine to Gaza . We are fed up with the empire of lies , "" they say . a viral video seen over 1.7 million times on X on this post alone where air dropped parachutes of aid falling down the sky into Gaza allegedly aid coming from China . So where did these videos come from then Catalina ? Sharon , this video does not show Chinese aid dropping into Gaza . This these claims are fake . We found the video published on a Tik Tok account on April 1st , originally posted here by a Palestinian man who he says lives in northern Gaza Strip . He published the video on Tik Tok as a call for a show of solidarity with the caption that reads , "" This is our situation . We die when we receive aid . We are silently exterminated . "" He says , "" Without , however , mentioning China . "" Then there are several incoherences with the viral claims that we saw when it comes to aid dates . The UN stated on X that no humanitarian aid has entered Gaza since March 2nd the date on which a total blockade was imposed by Israel . Hence no aid could have entered Gaza neither on May 10th per this post or May 12th or when these claims started going around neither on April 1 for that matter per the original video on Tik Tok . Then there 's also no indication that the airdrops were Chinese . The last recorded air aid delivery from the country dates back to February 18th when a truckload as you can see of aid was sent via Jordan showing that China has been providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza through more conventional means through car through trucks rather than the dramatic footage that we saw in the viral claims . This time around , this emergency aid consisted of 60,000 food parcels . The first 12,000 were received in Gaza on February 25th , according to these image published by Chinese TV . Hence , no aid sent from China , at least since February 18th , via trucks , no planes nor parachutes per the viral claims . Finally , then Katina , you found some other similar videos online accompanied by the same fake claims . Tell us more about that . That 's it . We found more videos , more compilations at least here , three different instances where users are sharing aid videos into Gaza falsely claiming that it 's coming from China . This is one example posted from 3 days ago on Tik Tok , so it 's still pretty recent . Today , they say Chinese planes broke the Israeli government 's blockade and entered the Gaza Strip to deliver food and aid . Thank you , China . when in fact this footage shows a United States airdrop over beta in northern Gaza from March 2024 . So it 's not even from this year . Then this footage where we see these planes flying over the pyramids in Egypt shows footage published online on May 1st , 2025 . that shows a joint Chinese air force training exercise over the pyramids in Ga of Giza during a military drill . However , not a Chinese airdrop over Gaza of aid . a compilation videos also showing different clips including the one we just showed all completely unrelated to any of these Chinese airdrops mentioned over Gaza . So , if any of these videos or claims going around , they 're all fake . Fake claims that were also circulating at about the same time when China called for an urgent international action at the UN Security Council to end humanitarian crisis in Gaza on May 13th for this briefing where China condemns Israel 's blockade and military operations , urging compliance with international law . Catalina , thanks so much for all of that . That 's Catalina there with tonight 's truth or fake . , that 's it from us for now . Do stay with us though for more world news here on France 24 .

https://youtu.be/c3Pb1ZWWQ1E?si=RbUfRqjnkqenEoz_,Trump calls Putin in push for Ukraine ceasefire,France 24 English,c3Pb1ZWWQ1E,"US President Donald Trump is speaking with Russia 's Vladimir Putin . The call between the two leaders comes as American led efforts to secure an end to the war in Ukraine hits an impass . On Friday , the first round of direct talks between Moscow and Keev were held in Istanbul . But it was n't the face - to - face meeting between Putin and Zilinski that Washington was hoping for . Donald Trump , however , says that the war in Ukraine will only end after he meets with Vladimir Putin himself . Now Trump is due to speak with Vladimir Zalanski after his call with Putin ends . For more on all of this , we can bring in our international affairs editor , Philip Tur . Philillip , can we expect a breakthrough from these calls ? , if the talks that were held in Istanbul is anything to go by , the differences between the Ukrainians and the Russians are so great that it is virtually impossible to believe that there can be a last minute breakthrough in this discussion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin . Remember that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is not the same thing as Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zalinsky talking together to try to find a way out of the war in Ukraine . Donald Trump has set himself up as being the world 's great peacemaker wanting to bring Vladimir Putin on board without really criticizing the Russian leader at all since Trump returned to the White House in January . So I think he is hoping today there can be some movement forward in all of this . But it 's very difficult to see what they will agree upon because Russia 's basic demands have remained unchanged since the start of the war back in February 2022 . And even there have been efforts the way down the line by Joe Biden , the former US president , by the European Union , by the Ukrainians , by the United Nations to try to bring Russia on board all to no avail . So , it 's really a long shot to think that Donald Trump can make Vladimir Putin change his mind . I think what the United States is trying to put forward as an argument is well , the US is tired , sorry , the Russians are tired of this war . They want a way out . , this is something that we 're going to try to negotiate with Vladimir Putin because this has lasted far longer than he expected because when he invaded Ukraine , he thought it was only going to be for three or four days and it would all be over . And here we are 3 years later and still the war is raging . It is raging . And earlier we had the US vice president who was asked about those US efforts to bring the war in Ukraine to an end . Take a listen to what JD Vance had to say . Look , I think one open question is Vladimir Putin serious about negotiating peace ? . He has made some concessions . He has taken some serious steps in these conversations , but we feel , , we 're at a point where we 're hitting an impass and that 's why the president is talking to him on the phone . That takes two to tango . I know the president 's willing to do that , but if Russia 's not willing to do that , then we 're eventually just going to have to say , "" This is not our war . It 's Joe Biden 's war . It 's Vladimir Putin 's war . It 's not our war . We 're going to try to end it , but if we ca n't end it , we 're eventually going to say , what , that was worth a try , but we 're not doing anymore . "" , that 's not our war . Worth a try , but we 're not doing it anymore . What does that mean to you ? , we 've had these remarks from the US administration before saying , "" , we 're just going to walk away from this war . "" But it 's very difficult for them to do that because they are involved militarily in supporting Ukraine and they there is there is a possibility they could pull out , but I think it would be far worse for them in the long run if they did do that . , I think this is JD Vance trying to put pressure on Vladimir Putin to come up with some an agreement . I think what we could see here if nothing happens today in this phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is that Donald Trump will then once again turn on Vladimir Zalinski the president of Ukraine and say you have got to make e effort on your side to pate Vladimir Putin by handing over the territory that he wants including Crimea refusing to join NATO . That 's something in any case that the United States has said that it is in favor of not joining the European Union , not agreeing to have troops from the coalition of the willing peacekeepers on the ground in Ukraine . All of those are conditions that are basic red lines for the Ukrainians and that 's something that Donald Trump could put the pressure on Vladimir Zalinsky over we already saw on the 28th of February in the Oval Office when they had this spat . So we do n't really know how this is going to turn out today . But as I said , it 's it 's a long shot to think that in one simple phone call , Vladimir Putin is going to agree to end the war , agree to a ceasefire , agree to peace talks when all the efforts up until now have n't led to that . And even it was Vladimir Putin himself who proposed the idea of these peace talks in Eastanbul and he did n't turn up to it . and neither did Vladimir Zalinsky and so Donald Trump said , "" , if I had gone , the two leaders would have been there . "" , we ca n't be sure that is true . So , we 'll see what comes out of this phone call , but , I think Donald Trump is going to find it more difficult than maybe he thinks to try to bring this war to an end in a in a very quick and easy way . We 'll see if Donald Trump does even manage to secure a meeting with the Russian president he says is needed to bring this war to an end . Thank you very much for that , Philip . of tell that ."
https://youtu.be/63lgoaAYHYM?si=jMg8XWPZ8YxMZXwN,Choose France' summit to bring 20 billion euros of new investment ,France 24 English,63lgoaAYHYM,"Now in the choose France international summit kicks off today in Versailles that 's being hosted by the French president Emanuel Macron who is hoping to lock in 20 billion euros worth of new investment after bringing in 15 billion last year . New projects are being announced in sectors including defense , energy and industry . Our Cammy Knight is at the incredible Versa Chateau where this is all taking place . She joins me from there . Cammy , first of all , tell us a bit more about what we can expect today and what announcements have been made already . Genie . , as , I 'm at the chat vers which has been locked up for from tourists today as CEOs are starting to trickle in for the choose France summit 2025 . they 'll be taking play they 'll be taking part in a number of roundts or bilateral meetings . But you mentioned , a lot of the work seems to have already been done because the French president has announced this 20 billion euros worth of investment in France , up from 15 billion last year . And , it goes up to 40 billion if you count investment in AI that had already been pledged some of it during the AI summit earlier this year , but now been confirmed in the form of contracts . Now , the French president will be making an appearance a little bit later today . He 'll be also giving a speech later on in the evening . now he 's touring a bus factory in east of France where German companies invested made a big investment to transition to electric vehicles . Another guest that we are expecting , organizers have teased him already , is French judo star Ti Reiner , who made a real name for himself here in France during the Olympics last year . And he 'll be addressing CEOs as well because not only is he an Olympic gold medalist , he 's also an entrepreneur with at least seven companies under his belt , if you will . so organizers have said that he really represented dynamism in France after he wowed the whole world during the Olympics . So Cammy here we have a lot of new businesses international businesses choosing France to invest . Why ? , it 's important to note that even though all these announcements are trickling in and there 's definitely a crescendo in the terms of amounts that we 're seeing particularly at these summits , we have to look at the context as well and there is a general decline in foreign direct investments in France but also across Europe . So , it 's a very much a trend a slightly less maybe rosy context . But for sure since Macron became president , he has been pushing a very pro business agenda . He 's made a lot of reforms . he 's brought corporate tax rates down and he 's really tried to promote France as a base for companies wishing to have an EU base after Brexit . And and France ranks particularly highly when it comes to manufacturing , research and development . the e energy as well which is something we saw during the ai summit as well where he really hammered home the idea that France had a lot of lowcarbon energy available for companies who wanted to come and build data centers and so that 's definitely something we 're seeing here and organizers have also chosen two more aspects to promote this year tourism and also the audiovisisual sector really trying to convince filmmakers and producers to come and make their films here in France of coincides with the Gan film festival . , and what better place to promote France than at the beautiful chat . Absolutely , Cammy ."
https://youtu.be/wr-M10RD0Mg?si=Hw48rc73TwiMr6hz,Caution on both sides': EU-UK summit a first step in 'deepening the relationship',France 24 English,wr-M10RD0Mg,"Now , 5 years after Britain officially left the EU , the two sides are set to seal a deal to renew some of those broken ties . They 're now set to sign new deals on fishing rights , defense , and freer movement for young people , including easier access to British universities for European students . British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is welcoming the EU President Ursula Vanderion in London today for that first summit since Brexit . We 're going to talk more about this now with Yaneka Woyak from UK in a changing Europe . She joins me live from London . Thanks for taking the time to speak to us . This is the first highlevel postrexit summit between the UK and EU . First of all , what prompted this summit to happen now in the first place ? So the summit is part of the Labour party 's ambition to reset relations with the European Union . there was an informal meeting between Kharma and Oslo on the line last year at which the two sides decided to hold the first formal post - rexit summit between the two sides which is taking place today and which both sides consider to be a milestone for the relationship . Now there are several new deals that are meant to be signed off on at some point today . What for you from what we know so far are the most important changes that could be coming ? So I think security and defense will be at the heart of the summit . The expectation is that the two sides will be able to announce some concrete outcomes in this area . This will include a geopolitical statement highlighting areas of joint interests such as their support or their ongoing support for Ukraine and then there will be a security and defense partnership as well . on trade and mobility issues there will be a road map outlining areas for further talk for example trade and agri food products youth mobility and emissions trading . So those are areas where further talks will be required after the summit . So whilst the summit is an important milestone , it 's also part of a longer process of negotiations that will continue beyond the summit itself . How committed would you say are both the EU and the UK to following through on all of this ? So the both the two sides have been clear that they want they want to pursue deeper ties . at the same time I would say they are both still being cautious when it comes to this relationship . On the UK side you still have similar red lines to the ones you had in previous Conservative governments including a no to the single market , a no to the customs union and a no to freedom of movement . on the EU side similarly you still have concern about British attempts of cherrypicking . there is a caution or anxiety of not wanting to create a president for the United Kingdom where other third countries Switzerland or Norway could then complain that this upsets the balance of rights and obligations for third countries . So whilst it is a first step towards deepening the relationship , I think there is still caution on both sides and the ambition for the summit is modest at best . Indeed . And it even seems the actual summit itself is more of a low - key affair being held at Downing Street . Would you agree ? , I think the summit is a low - key affair in the sense that you do n't have member states present . you have the EU institutions present but at the same time that 's not unusual for an EU summit with a third country . The EU holds summits with other key partners all the time and that 's usually at the level of the EU institutions . So I would n't read too much into that . but at the same time I think there 's also recognition on both sides that this summit is only the start of a longer process and they know that there will be more difficult and technical talks to come down the line . Yanukica , just to wrap up , what would you say is the general feeling of people in the UK 5 years post Brexit ? Do most people still think it was the move ? I think in general , a majority of people in the United Kingdom think that Brexit has been more of a failure than a success and a majority of people are in favor of closer ties with the European Union . But that does n't mean that people necessarily want to see another referendum . people are frankly sick and tired of Brexit as a topic , they do n't really want to hear about it any longer . so whilst there is support for closer relations , there is still people who think that Brexit itself was n't necessarily a bad idea , but so the people who voted to leave merely think that the government implemented it badly . so still very nuanced views but overall I would say there is support for a closer relationship also given the change geopolitical environment we find ourselves in . All Yanukica thanks for that Yanica Woyak from UK in a changing Europe . Thank you ."

This is from Israel 's Prime Minister Benamin Netanyahu saying that Israel will control all of Gaza . Now , that is he also said that Israel can not allow famine in the country after Israel eased its blockade and has let some aid in . The country 's military has said it 's begun extensive ground operations in the northern and southern parts of the enclave . It follows a series of deaths over the weekend . Palestinian health officials saying at least 130 people were killed in the strip overnight Saturday to Sunday . , let 's bring in our correspondent Ngatanapolski who joins us now from Jerusalem . Noga , bring us up to date then with exactly what Benamin Netanyahu has said . [ Music ] , we 've been witness here in the last hour to two extraordinary statements by the prime minister of Israel and his finance minister who held a airat press conference . The reason I 'm saying they 're extraordinary is that in each case the men implied that it had been Israel 's intention to cause the starvation of two million people . And the reason that they had to allow that their hands were tied and that they had to allow humanitarian aid in is because the world opinion would n't allow them to move ahead . Each man in his own phrases said we ca n't starve them and keep our operations going in Gaza . The world wo n't let us . So it is quite a moment of which most Israelis are not yet aware because it 's the middle of a working day here in Israel . , it follows , does n't it ? , Israel increasing its activities , if that 's the word , within the Gaza Strip over the last 24 hours or so . Israel began escalating its operation in Gaza already around 3 days ago , just as President Trump , who by the way has also said that the United States will control all of Gaza , , just as he was leaving this region . I do n't think there 's been a more major escalation in the last 24 hours , but what we do see is the Israeli government transmitting increasingly aggressive , even almost barbaric statements from the top officials of this government , even as in the real world it continues to negotiate in Doha for some accommodation or agreement with Hamas under tremendous American pressure and Even also as it begins in fact to allow these humanitarian trucks carrying not only food but also medication into the Gaza Strip . This is not something that Prime Minister Netanyahu wanted to do and he is not hiding to his base here in Israel that he feels his hand was forced ."

Diplomatic efforts continuing then to try to find a way forward . So far , though , critics saying they 've achieved very little . It comes after Ukraine says Russian drone attacks over the weekend were the largest ever . At least 273 drones launched overnight Saturday into Sunday morning , destroying homes and killing at least one woman there . , we 're going to cross to Ke talk to our correspondent , Emanuel Shaz , who joins us from there . Emanuel , we 've had a series of talks and conversations between delegations and world leaders . Little to show for it so far . Little to show . And also , Ukrainians are very much aware that every time it came to a ceasefire since 2014 , , Russia violated its terms . so there 's no history on the Ukrainian side to see any willingness from Moscow to end the fighting and it 's a Russian aggression against Ukraine which is defending itself there . So of course people here will be very attentive to what is going to be said between Washington and Moscow especially after the direct talks that took place in Istanbul 3 days ago . they on the diplomatic level there was no result so to say in those talks because Russia has n't changed its conditions to agree to a ceasefire . We see that Russia still has the same demands it had back in March 22 back to the last direct talks before Istanbul between Moscow and Kief . It still essentially wants the capitulation of Ukraine . It wants a neutral Ukraine . demilitarized Ukraine . you a Ukraine that would have no prospect of ever joining NATO and also it wants that Ukraine seeds territories illegally occupy Crimea but also partially illegally occupied oblasts regions of Luhans Donets Herson and Zaporia where Russian troops are n't even occupying the entirety of the region and those terms are simply unacceptable for Ukraine . So there the hope here from the government would be that Donald Trump would try and persuade Vladimir Putin to a temporary ceasefire and also accentuates the pressure on the Russian president . So talking to people there , Emanuel , would you say there 's any hope for these this latest phone call there on the streets ? Frankly , there is more hope in the West than there is in Ukraine . I said , Ukrainians are used since 2014 to what Russia is doing to their country and also the Ukrainian population . We have to remind our viewers are under Russian bombs every day . You 've mentioned those drone attacks over the weekend , 273 drones , that 's the record launched by Russia against Ukraine . says here in Kiev , a mother , a 27year - old mother who died while she was sheltering her son from an incoming kamicazi drone . This is a daily reality here in Ukraine . Over the weekend , there 's a bus that was hit by a kamicazi drone in the Sunumi region . Nine people died . Most of them were elderly women . so when you are confronted to that reality for Ukrainians , , they simply can not see any will from the Russian side to decrease the amount of fighting . The fighting is still ongoing on the front line . Assaults are still continuing along the front lines . So in that context , it 's very difficult for Ukrainians to have any hope that Russia , if not pressured , would agree to a ceasefire , would agree to meaningful talks with Ukraine . Emanuel , thanks very much . Emanuel Shaz there , our correspondent talking to us from Keefe ."

It only takes a few seconds to recognize his idiosyncratic visual style . From the perfectly symmetrical shots and elaborate set designs to the whimsical characters that populate his films . Suicide panel . Where 's Anderson 's unique cinematography is unlike anything else on the silver screen . A self - taught director , the 56 - year - old from Houston , Texas , has always stood by an old school style of film making . I am particularly drawn to the old techniques , and I ca n't say that I 've ever said , I wish we did this all on a green screen . Since the early days of his career in the mid 1990s , a theatrical troop , Wes Anderson surrounded himself with a familiar cast of actors and technicians . Until the end of July , France 's prestigious cinematic Frances is paying tribute to his work . Films The Grand Budapest Hotel , a 2014 box office hit with its colorful poetic universe , have earned him a cult following . Since his first film until his last film , you have on the one hand these clumsy burles characters , characters who struggle with their environment , the world in which they evolve and on the other hand melancholy nostalgia something very emotional satre or frana trufo just some of the artistic inspirations for Wes Anderson 's films his influences also or extend to literature with works by JD Salinger and Rald Dah leaving their mark on his vision strongly shaped by themes of childhood . [ Music ] It 's everybody 's childhood . There is something naive about it but also the desire for conquest to come into contact with something typical , innocent , beautiful which is part of childhood . We see it everywhere in his cinema . This year , Wes Anderson is hoping to win the palm door with the Phoenician scheme . Three of his films have already competed for the prize at Can , but he 's yet to pick up one of the most coveted prizes in cinema ."
https://youtu.be/fb-9N3Ax1Kg?si=468FuvOtqk6nyHnu,Cleaning up Fukushima: Decommissioning work continues on nuclear power plant,France 24 English,fb-9N3Ax1Kg,"[ Music ] Two pairs of special socks have to be worn on the site . We start with the first pair . These precautions have become second nature for Takahara who works at the Fukushima Dichi Nuclear Power Plant . Socks , masks , and gloves . We also put on protective gear that enables us to access the green area where radiation levels are lowest and which accounts for 96 % of the entire site . The Tokyo Electric Power Company , which owned and operated the plant during the disaster , is using robots to extract hazardous melted fuel from the damaged reactors . In November , 14 years after the disaster , the robots made a breakthrough . For the first time , they were able to extract 0.7 g of harmful radioactive debris . A tiny quantity given that the remaining amount is estimated at 880 tons . On March the 11th , 2011 , Japan was struck by the most powerful earthquake in its modern history . The quake unleashed a tsunami that killed almost 19,000 people along the northeast coast . Three reactors at the Fukushima plant melted down after a 15 m high wave breached its protective seaw wall and crippled its backup power supply . In the days that followed , hydrogen explosions rocked reactor buildings . Radioactive material leaked into the atmosphere . After the disaster , TCO was accused of downplaying the risks posed by tsunami . The utility has since built a new barrier , a reinforced seaw wall based on a French design . Although the structure can block tsunamis of up to 60 m in height , we 're also preparing for the possibility of even more powerful waves . Additionally , if water accumulates , we can get rid of it using a drainage system . TCO was faced with the huge task of dealing with water that 's used to cool the reactors . After being treated , the water was stored in these giant tanks . They now contain enough water to fill 510 Olympic size swimming pools . But the utility was unable to remove one radioactive element , tritium . Instead , workers dilute the treated water with seawater to bring tritium down to safe levels before pumping it into the Pacific . The World Health Organization safety limit for tritium is 10,000 beckerels per liter . The levels at Fukushima dichi are 25 times lower . Amid concern from nearby countries such as China and South Korea , fish were placed in treated water containing higher doses of tritium for 2 years . Experts say the water does not pose a threat to the environment or human health . The mortality rate is exactly the same in fish raised in normal seawater as it is among those raised in the treated water mixture containing tritium . TCO and local officials have struggled to persuade evacuated residents to return . There were concerns over a small number of cancer cases among plant workers that were attributed to radiation exposure . Several people who were children at the time of the disaster and have developed thyroid cancer are seeking compensation from TCO . While some areas are still off limits , others have been cleared for residents to return . [ Music ] This family moved from Tokyo 2 years ago and now live about 5 kilometers from the plant . This is a doimeter . We each have one and wear it at all times . How often do we receive the results ? Atmospheric radiation levels here are 7 to 10 times higher than in Tokyo , but they 're still below international safety thresholds . Each of these parents has a dosimter to use outside and two for indoors . Local authorities announce radiation levels daily . These residents say they 're adapting to life here . When we go outside to play with the kids , we pay close attention to radiation levels . If the readings show it 's safe , we stay out a little longer , maybe 2 or 3 hours , while the kids play . The Yamaguchi family chose this area for its public school . Founded two years ago , it stresses individual education and the importance of play . The aim is to attract families with children aged up to 15 . If this school did n't exist , I probably would n't have come here , I would have stayed in Tokyo . The school had just 26 pupils when it opened . Now it has 85 , 70 % of whom are from other regions . The school 's principal believes Japan 's rigid education system , which discourages people from questioning authority , was partly responsible for the 2011 disaster . You wo n't find anything in textbooks about how our town will be rebuilt or how to deal with the uncertain future facing Japan and the world . We believe children should learn to think for themselves and become more independent in their learning . While residents build new lives near the site of Japan 's worst nuclear disaster , decommissioning work at Fukushima Dichi is expected to continue for at least another three decades ."

She 's starting with Gaza . Israeli air strikes have reportedly killed scores of Palestinians across the enclave on Sunday . That 's , Stuart . The British Daily Dindependent reported that Israel has started a major new Gaza ground offensive . The paper says that the ground operation was announced after indirect talks with Hamas in Qatar did n't show much progress . , but I want to draw your attention to this article here in the British paper the times that talks about leaked maps by diplomats that talk about a new proposed division of the Gaza Strip . The headline the headline reads leaked map shows Israeli proposal to force gazins into strips of land . And I 'm going to show you the map here so we can see what this proposal looks . So there would be three civilian regions divided by three military areas here . And let 's not forget that the Gaza Strip is 40 kilometers long . So really not much space to start with . And the paper says that this would mean that civilians would be forbidden to travel between the sections without permission which will separate families from their close ones and from their land . to you Stuart . We 're moving to Europe 's election super Sunday . Now , Romania 's pro - EU candidate beat his -wing rival . How are the papers reaction to that one ? . , super Sunday . , it 's super Sunday because it talks about Poland , Portugal , and Romania . There were elections in all three countries . But let me focus on Romania this time . The mayor of Bucharest , Nikico Shardan , defeated George Simeon , who won the first round of the presidential election . Simeon is a nationalist aligned with President Trump , writes the New York Times . The article calls the win a setback for Europe 's surging nationalist forces that will likely calm fears in Europe . Politico then talks about the two different reactions that we have . On the one hand , the Tate Bro tears and EU delight . Tate Bro , this he 's talking about , of course , the Tate brothers here . they are popular misogynist influencers who were implicated in vast investigation into human trafficking and rape in Romania . And Tristan Tate , who is the brother of Andrew Tate , after seeing the results , tweeted , "" , Romania , we had a good run . "" but for the European Union , Danwin is a huge relief writes political . we have then some reactions from local Romanian papers . Bura here writes that Romania avoided regime change but not systemic crisis . The country is now entering a period of fragile transition . More controversy . some Romanian flag controversy . This is on social media . Tell us about this , Elisa . That 's , Stuart . , , George Simeon , the farright candidate , tweeted , "" I am the new president of , "" and he used this flag emoji . Of course , he wanted to say Romania , but he used the emoji of Chad . , he was , of course , , fast corrected , by X itself . , and , it 's it 's an easy mistake to make , however , because as you can see , the two flags are really similar . The only difference is the shades of the colors . That did n't stop many social media users from making fun of him online . Let 's take a look at this tweet . Breaking news . Chad elects George Simeon as president . Romania breeds a sigh of relief , tweeted this user here . I never noticed that they were that similar before . he will no doubt never make that mistake again . To France now . Interior Minister Bruno Ratio winning the vote to head the Conservative Le Republican party here in France with more than 70 % of the vote . . so let 's talk about Republican first . This is the party of the French conservatives . It 's also the party of former president Nicolola Saruzi and Jac Shira when it was known as the UMP . interior minister Bruno is now heading the conservatives . far -wing newspaper Luffigo calls his win a new hope for the and L Parisian writes describes the interior minister as the eternal second just time to talk about seagulls now in the UK seagull attacks are on the rise it 's a very serious issue that deserves a cover story here as we can see raging gulfs half of Brits assault ed by crazy birds . It 's 35 million people per year that have been attacked by these birds . So , the Brits have quite strong feelings about seagulls and quite strong feelings about dogs . Here we can see that they have they had this festival that 's called Goodwolf . it 's a two - day festival that took place in West Sussex over the weekend . it 's really a thing where you pamper your dogs . Let 's take a look here at some pictures . You had dog massage , you had dog yoga , and dogs had fun . Unfortunately , my dog could n't attend . , I 'm sorry to that . What 's your dog called ? Masha . Masha . Sorry , Masha . Next time . Thanks a lot . It 's a good day with the papers on France"
https://youtu.be/mwCE8pS86ig?si=zSYvXQsvMDHRF8hw,Liberal candidate loses out in first round of Polish election despite lead in poll,France 24 English,mwCE8pS86ig,"Rafael Troskovski coming first as predicted with 30.8 % of the vote and Carol Navroski just behind him with 29.1 . A pretty small gap there between the two men . when this election campaign started the gap was much bigger . Rafel Troskovski 's lead was much bigger . So it 's can be considered an unsuccessful campaign for him and a successful one for Carol Navroski and a very close second round coming up in a couple of weeks . All the more so because perhaps the biggest sensation of the night is the result of the third place candidate Suavomir Mensen from the farright Confederatia party . He according to the exit poll has got 15.4 % . And there 's another farright candidate odious Jeor Brown who 's had anti - semitic rhetoric . Rafael Troskovski even walked out of a TV debate with him because he said he 's just not prepared to listen to the kinds of things this guy says . This Jehosh Brown who 's even pro - Russian I think it 's fair to say got 6.2 % 2 % . Adding up the votes of the far to I 'm so bad at math , but it comes to more than 20 % , does n't it ? And those are votes that are probably more likely to go to Carol Navrosky in the second round than to Rafael Treskovski . Though it 's maybe a little bit more complicated than that . Polling did show that a certain proportion of the far- voters , strange as it may seem , would be likely to vote for Treskovski in the second round , but certainly only a minority . To comfort Treskovski , he has got the voters of the left to probably count on in the second round , but their scores add up to less than 10 % , the two main leftwing candidates . So , if you add in a third leftwing candidate , Yuan Sendish , I think they get just over 10 % between them . but it 's a showing for the left according to the exit poll that is disappointing and a showing for the far that shows them finally delivering in a way on their poll promise because up until now in Polish elections what we had seen was that the far would poll very high in opinion polls a few weeks before the actual polling day and then on the night not do quite as well as people predicted . If the exit pole 's to be believed , this time it has n't happened"
https://youtu.be/pfXHTUKEWrY?si=CexAik-Ys7Q_HJxI,Early exit polls favour centrist candidate in Romania presidential election,France 24 English,pfXHTUKEWrY,"Exactly . , Nikico Dan just appeared on the stage that 's behind me . I 'm in Bucharest 's most central most park in front of the city hall . And they his supporters are chanting . They seem to be already celebrating these exit poll results . But we have to be very careful because these exit polls do n't include the diaspora . the diaspora that had massively voted for George Simeon during the first round two weeks ago . the actual results are now available will now be available on a room minutebyminute updated basis on the website of the electoral authority . So we 'll be able to track that as the night moves forward . We 'll have the final results probably very late in the night . But as you can hear maybe behind me for the supporters of Nushar Dan it 's already almost time to celebrate . So we 'll we 'll have to see later on if the mood keeps being as victorious as it is now if it does go this way obviously as you 've said with many caveats so far . Tell us about Nicarash down because this is a Paris trained mathematician I believe I 'm in saying seen as more of an intellectual . He 's fought on this anti - corruption platform , has n't he ? , and I 'll probably get this wrong . You 'll say it better than I can , Maria , but there 's the saying , is n't the labo laal to the ball or to the hospital ? He 's staked everything on this attempt to become president . Nikico Sharddan is a mathematician . He used to be a anti - corruption activist . He 's running as an independent candidate . he 's saying that he 's pro- European , he 's aligned , let 's say , on the values , the policies of Brussels . while George Simeon , as we know , is very critical of Brussels , of the European Union . So that 's where they oppose each other among many other things . he has campaign on campaigned on this image of an honest politician . That 's of course a reference to the other presidents , the other parties that have run Romania since the fall of communism that are seen as very corrupt , as having lied to the Romanian people . And this is what a lot of voters have in mind when they go to polls . , at the same time , a lot of voters feel he is not he does n't represent enough of a change , not he 's maybe not a the radical change that they want . He 's the mayor of Bucharest . he founded also a center- party that he then left but this in parliament and so he has to find the balance between these two things but so far for as we can see in the exit polls he has benefited from higher mobilization there 's been higher voter turnout today than what we 've seen during the first round two weeks ago so He also hoped to mobilize , , maybe a lot of people in the diaspora who did n't come out to vote last week . What turnout we 're seeing so far , Maria ? , voter turnout has gone over 60 % , two weeks ago , we 've had 53 % . in the diaspora , there 's been also record levels of voter turnout . This shows how important this election is for Romanians not only in the country but also abroad . We have about 4 million Romanians living abroad . The estimates the figures vary of course but a lot of people have had to leave the country to find job to find a better life abroad and some of them say that they now want to come back . So that might be one of the reasons why they 're so involved and George Simeon had campaigned massively in the diaspora . this week he was in France , he was in the United Kingdom , he was in Italy . so he 's also capitalized a lot on this diaspora and tried to find the words to seduce them ."

Pope Leo wasted no time setting the tone for his papacy in his inaugural mass , calling out global systems that harm the planet and the marginalized . In this our time , we see too much discord , too many wounds caused by hatred , violence , prejudices , the fear of difference , and an economic paradigm that exploits the earth 's resources and marginalizes the poorest . The Pope vowed to make the church a force for peace in the world . and he called for unity , a word he used seven times during his remarks . His predecessor left a divided church with conservatives accusing Francis of sewing confusion with off - the- cuff remarks that sent mixed messages . Many in the crowd expressed their hopes that Pope Leo will be able to bridge divisions . I would say all of the Americans are emotional about it . , having an American pope is not something we ever thought would happen . It 's really powerful for American Catholics who sometimes feel separated from the world church to be brought in and included in this community through Pope Leo . I hope it 's potentially a way to bring everybody together . There 's obviously a lot of conflicts around the world and I hope that the Pope can potentially be a healer and a connection to everybody . The Pope did not shy away from global events calling for an end to conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine . Among the congregation attending the mass in Rome , world leaders including Ukrainian President Womir Zalinski and US Vice President JD Vance . The Pope is scheduled to hold his first private audience with Zalinski to discuss the Ukraine war ."

The race pits far- nationalist George Simeon , a euroskeptic and self - described Trumpist against Nicoserdan , the pro - EU mayor of the capital Bucharest . It is a redo of last year 's vote that was won by a far- ally of Simeon , but anoldled over allegations of interference . The outcome could reshape Romania 's relationship with both the EU and neighboring Ukraine . And all of Europe , of course , is closely watching . For more , we can cross now to our correspondent , Maria Garrett Nicollescu , who 's in the Romanian capital . Maria , voting has been underway for a couple hours now . Tell us what 's the latest . How 's it going so far ? , I 'm in a polling station in the capital , Bucharest , where voting has started at 7 a.m. a local time this morning . So far things are relatively calm , but voting started in the diaspora on Thursday evening already for some countries on Friday morning for Western Europe , for example , France , Italy , where there are a lot of Romanians living abroad . And what we 've seen so far with the with the past days of voting in the diaspora is a very high voter turnout , higher than what we 've seen for the first round two weeks ago . And what this shows is that Romanians are living a historic moment . They 're conscious of the stakes of this elections . It 's two ideological viewpoints , two views of Europe , two views of what patriotism means that are opposing themselves . , George Simeon had a 20 % advance over Nikushan in the first round , but the gap has been slowly closing as we 've seen in the in the recent polls with both candidates being very close to each other in terms of in terms of polls . We 'll have to see the final result including the diaspora because the diaspora has massively voted for George Simeon last time and we 'll have the first exit polls at 9:00 p.m. local time today . All . So , a high turnout so far as you said , indicative of the high stakes in this election . Can you talk a little bit about more about what have been the main concerns for Romanian voters ? , several topics were mentioned o over the campaign , including during the debates that have happened between the two candidates , as well as on social media . George Simeon has mainly campaigned on social media and in the diaspora with visits to France , to the UK and to Italy . Among the main topics , we have of course what change Romania 's want , Romanians want in terms of their economy . both candidates presenting themselves as being against anti- system , against the system , against the political class that is seen as corrupt and that has dominated Romania 's political scene over the past 30 over 30 years . So , a lot of talk about the economy , development , fighting corruption . George Simeon says that he wants to bring the diaspora back home . A lot of Romanians have immigrated because of lack of jobs , lack of economic opportunity opportunities . But as the country is developing , a lot of them are considering to move back to Romania . , Nikushardan on the other hand is saying that Romania has made a lot of progress . He wants to continue the country 's pro - western , pro- European path . He 's quite aligned with the politics and the values promoted in Brussels . That brings us to the second main topic of this campaign which is Romania 's position in the world in Europe . George Simeon is very critical of Brussels . Also wants Romania to stop providing aid to Ukraine . He 's very aligned with the MAGA politics of Donald Trump . While Nikushdan is seen more as a center a candidate , liberal candidate aligned with Brussels and the European Union . All . We will be keeping a close eye of who comes out the winner of that election . Thank you so much , Maria , for that update . We 'll be crossing to you , I 'm sure , throughout the day . That 's our correspondent , Maria Garrett Nicollescu , reporting there from Bucharest ."

So this is a important symbolic ceremony . he began the entire thing by praying at the tomb of St. Peter inside the basilica before with a procession he came into the square and we saw also some symbolic moments where he was presented with the papal paleium . Now that 's the lamb 's wool stole that is placed on him . this is a symbol of the papacy . It 's a symbol as he is the shepherd now leading the flock and he will he also receives the fisherman 's ring that is the ring that seals papal documents . So those two symbols very important for the start of this papacy . Of course very significant that we 've also got those delegations up top the Italian delegation of course with President Sergio Matalera as well as Prime Minister Georgia Milani but also the representatives from the United States and Peru because of course Pope Leo has a dual citizenship . So you have the US vice president JD Vance as well as the secretary of state Marco Rubio but also the Peruvian president and as well as the presidents of Israel as well in pre present here today and the prime ministers of Australia , Canada and France . So really top leaders present for this very important service that marks the start of this pontificate ."
https://youtu.be/6P8UKEQQYl4?si=MWr25NKO_9MoqpPE,Poland votes in tight election influenced by the war in Ukraine ,France 24 English,6P8UKEQQYl4,", Europe is also keeping a close eye on the presidential election in Poland this Sunday . Polls have opened there as well . For the past year and a half , the centrist ruling coalition of Donald has had to share power with Poland 's outgoing conservative nationalist president , Anjay Duda , who has blocked key government initiatives . Now , that could change this Sunday if the pro - EU mayor of Warsaw , Rafaovski , comes out on top . He has been polling ahead of his rival , the nationalist historian , Carol Nadsky . Our correspondent Guliver Craig sent us this update from Warsaw . A parliamentary republic , but the president also has important powers . He is responsible in part for foreign policy , particularly traditionally at least , for relations with the United States and NATO . He or she can initiate legislation , but perhaps most importantly , they can block anything that is voted by the parliament by opposing their veto to it . And that 's why it 's been a huge headache for the incoming Liberal government led by Prime Minister Donal Tusk that Andre Duda , the outgoing president who 's from the opposing political camp , the Nationalist Conservatives of the Law and Justice Party , still had more than a year and a half of his second term to remain in office after they won the parliamentary elections in 2023 . So there 's been an uneasy period of cohabitation in which the government has been saying they ca n't put in place their program because Andre Duda is threatening to block any legislation that he does n't or perhaps even any legislation that he thinks could be seen as a success for them . So , Prime Minister Donald Tusk is very much hoping that he 's going to be able to put an end to this difficult period and finish the job , if you , of bringing liberal pro - Uropean Poland back to the center of European life by having his ally Rafael Cheskovski , the mayor of Warsaw , currently installed in the presidential palace behind me . In order to try to prevent this from happening , law and justice have decided to put forward a candidate who 's a political novice . Carol Navroszky has been director of the Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk and of the Institute of National Memory . Now , according to Polish electoral laws , I 'm not allowed to give you details about what the opinion polls have been saying , but I think I am allowed to go so far as to say it looks being a close race and one that is almost certain to go to a second round because in addition to the two leading candidates that I 've mentioned , there are candidates on the left and on the far who are growing in popularity . And we seem to be seeing in Poland , as we 've seen in many other countries in Europe , a reduction in the levels of support for the mainstream traditional parties of government ."
https://youtu.be/uvAxZmTLvzU?si=b1t32kxy1wtdISO2,Pope Leo XIV celebrates inaugural Mass before thousands at St Peter's Square,France 24 English,uvAxZmTLvzU,"And we begin at the Vatican where it 's going to be a big day of ritual and diplomacy as Pope Leo the 14th gives his inaugural mass . Huge crowds are expected in St. Peter 's Square and Basilica where you can see them gathering now in those live images . A ceremony filled with religious symbolism that connects to the Pope 's special mission as the head of the Catholic Church . In addition to the prayers , there will also be politics with a number of leaders expected to be in attendance , including Ukrainian President Vladimir Zalinski and US Vice President JD Vance . Let 's head to Rome now and speak to our correspondent , Sema Gupta . Sema , walk us through what 's going to be taking place this Sunday . , Alison , as you can see behind me , there 's really , really tight security here today . More than 5,000 police officers deployed because of course , they 're expecting more than 250,000 people to come to St. Peter Square for this inauguration celebration for the start of Pope Leo I 14th 's pontificate . and , you 're . It is a deeply religious ceremony , but it kicks off with a moment of celebration . he will is expected to appear in the Pope mobile going through the square and greeting the faithful . Of course , very poignant because of course , let 's not forget it was Easter Sunday not too long ago that we saw Pope Francis on a Pope mobile and of course his body also being taken and laid to rest at another papal basilica here in Rome . But now of course all eyes on Leo I 14th . after that appearance in the square he will go back inside the basilica . There will be a solemn moment of prayer at St. Peter 's tomb and then he will come back outside again in procession with the other cardinals and all everyone will be looking to see what his homaly says because during the service that 's when we might get a better idea of what his pontificate will be . There will be other two other significant moments in the service . One in which he 's given the papal paleium . Now , this is a lamb 's wool stole that is placed on his shoulders , and it 's supposed to be a symbol of him as a shepherd leading the flock of the Catholic faithful . And the second thing he will be given is the fisherman 's ring . Now , this ring has the image of St. Peter 's as well as his name , Leo the 14 engraved on it . And it will become the ring that is used to seal papal documents . Now , when Pope Francis died , that ring was destroyed . It marks the end of that papacy . And so now he is going to start again with his papacy . So two very significant moments . But for the faithful that are gathering here going through security are rushing to get that best spot . It really is an important moment for them to be here at the start of the pontificate . All . A big moment for Catholics then . It 's not all about the prayers though today . There also is expecting to be quite a bit of politics as well . Tell us more Sema about some of the leaders that are going to be there . , there are about 150 delegations that includes heads of state as well as royals . You 've got the from the United States because of course the pope is a native of the US . he 's from Chicago . He was born there and so we have the US vice president JD Vance as well as the secretary of state Marco Rubio . both of them are practicing Catholics and also you have a delegation a significant delegation from Peru . That 's because Pope Leo does hold a dual citizenship . So the Peruvian president is also present . Then you 've got prime ministers from Canada , Australia , and France . You even have the Ukrainian president as you mentioned Vodil Zalinski and of course the president of Israel as well as other leaders from around the world . Now all eyes will be on the interactions between these different leaders because of course we do remember Mr. Zalinski meeting JD Vance at the White House and that was not a pleasant meeting . how will the interactions be here ? Mr. Zilinski himself has said he 's open to meeting any world leaders while he 's here . the senator Marco Rubio has also stressed the idea that Pope Fran Pope Leo also mentioned the idea of the Vatican being a site for potential dialogue between Ukraine and Russia . Marco Rubio did meet the papal envoy to Ukraine on Saturday when he arrived . So there is possible discussions that maybe this could lead to the Vatican being the site for potential peace talks . and then of course are we going to see Mr. Zilinski meet the pope directly as well as Mr. Vance meeting the pope directly ? So lots of bilateral meetings , lots of interest interesting interactions between the different leaders . So it 's not all religious . Definitely there 's also a lot of politics that happens at these massive papal events . And France 244 of course will be keeping a special eye on the politics although the ceremony should hopefully be enjoyable as well . Sema , thank you so much for that update . That 's our correspondent Sema Gupta there reporting from Rome ."
https://youtu.be/-KFp0ODFC30?si=41Ev1-WX5mmTP_qD,Is Donald Trump really planning to move 1 million Palestinians to Libya?,France 24 English,-KFp0ODFC30,"from Jerusalem . Let 's bounce to Washington DC because staying with the same theme for a moment , David Smith , who 's the guardian bureau chief is there . David , great to talk to you tonight . Reports in the past 24 hours , I 'm sure , but you switch on pretty much most of the US networks now talking about reports of this plan by the Trump administration , , to move 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to Libya . Tell us about that . That 's . This is an NBC news report which so there 's been some push back from the state department and white house about . But apparently according to this report the white house has been in talks with leaders in Libya about a plan to relocate up to 1 million Palestinians from Gaza and in return the US would agree to unfreeze billions of dollars of Libyan funds . they 've been frozen of course since the uprising against Gaddafi and the civil war that followed about 14 years ago . since when of course there 's been a civil war , Libya still has two competing rival governments . , now all of this fits with what we 've been hearing from Donald Trump in recent weeks and months about his idea of redeveloping Gaza putting it under US control even turning it into what he called a Riviera of the Middle East . he said that at a press conference with Benjamin Netanyahu in the last few days he 's reiterated that idea of turning Gaza into a freedom zone . , initially there was talk of moving Palestinians to , Egypt or Jordan . , again neither country was really happy with that idea . , so now Libya comes up , but I think , still all sorts of problems and objections to this . There 's the moral objection that many would say this is frankly tantamount to ethnic cleansing and already there 's been criticism of it from leaders of Hamas and also on a logistical and practical level moving a million people by road or plane would be extremely difficult and expensive . Very interesting also that President Trump who probably tweets I think AI have worked out probably a small novel every single month has n't mentioned anything about Libya yet . , indeed . he 's been pretty busy on social media talking about everything from Taylor Swift to Bruce Springsteen and certainly pushing his legislation with Republicans in Congress . but he does n't appear to have tackled this one yet . and , certainly the White House National Security Council and the State Department both said these reports are untrue . So we shall have to see how this one pans out . , it gets very personal in some of these messages . Goes into a detail that you do wonder for a president there must be questions about on particularly Bruce Springsteen as you say called him dumb as a rock . he could n't see what was going on or could he ? He 's dried out prune of a rocker commerce his skin is all atrophied . That was President Trump in last 24 hours . Let me also talk to you about a scandal . what 's in the message ? The seashells on the seashore . This is the Instagram photo . Let 's take a look . 8647 put out by the former FBI chief James Comey . Something he 'd seen on the beach . He said it ended up with US Secret Services at his door alleged to be encouraging violence against President Trump . President Trump has told news reporters that 86 this number is slang for to assassinate to get rid of and 47 that 's his presidency the 47th presence . Let 's have a let 's take a listen to him . Exactly what that meant . A child knows what that meant . If you 're the FBI director and you do n't know what that meant , that meant assassination . And it says it loud and clear . Now , he was n't very competent , but he was competent enough to know what that meant . And he did it for a reason . And he was hit so hard because people me and they what 's happening with our country . Our country 's become respected again and all this . and he 's calling for the assassination of the president . A child knows what it means , David . Is that what it means ? , James Comey , who of course is a former FBI director and was fired by Donald Trump in 2017 , although a lifelong Republican , he acknowledges , that he does know this was a political message . He says one about getting rid of something and that 's the supposed code of 86 . there 's much dispute over the origins of that phrase . perhaps it dates back to the prohibition era when there was a bar on 86 Barrow Street and an exit that people were thrown out , but other theories as well . James Comey denies that he there was he thought it was any connection to violence or assassination , but he did delete the post . interestingly Republicans and Trump supporters have previously bought t - shirts that had 8646 written on them , which was code for getting rid of or impeaching Joe Biden when he was president . But in any case , this has been seized on by Trump , as you heard there , and many of his allies . Tulsi Gabbard , director of national intelligence , saying Comey should be put behind bars . Reports now that Comey has been interviewed by the Secret Service with regard to this . , so I 'm sure this one will continue to run . David , always a pleasure to speak to you . You can see what from his team , for example , why they might be concerned given that there had been assassination attempts . that as you say his own team had previously worn including Matt Gates the former attorney general nominee he tweeted as well we 40 with 86 Joe Biden so it has been used many times before pleasure as always David Smith the guardian bureau chief in Washington DC we 'll be back with The"
https://youtu.be/G174QgZpeuU?si=gM8B2Lvfju0Rnqod,Gaza: What is Israel's goal with the new military operation it just launched? ,France 24 English,G174QgZpeuU,", for more , I 'm joined in the studio by our international affairs commentator , Doug Herbert . , Doug . , so what are Israel 's objectives and how , , how is it defending its actions amid the ongoing , international criticism , including to that of the blocking of humanitarian aid ? . The object , look , we 're having deja vu all over again , ? because it sounds the narrative we 're telling now it is return press return to the earliest days of this war during the height of the early bombardment of the Gaza enclave shortly after the Hamas attacks on Israel and the taking of those hostages in the winter of 2023 2024 . here we are again . We saw those images in the package in that report there showing a Gaza that really looks a little bit Berlin after World War II . in areas even worse if that 's even possible . what we have are the same official explanations , ? it 's the narrative is now engraved in marble . It is to defeat Hamas and it is to get all the hostages released because there 's still an estimated 58 hostages still being held in Gaza of which 20 are believed to be to still be alive . so that 's the official line . Unofficially though , we 've had this week the UN human rights commissioner , Vulker Turk , just in the past couple of days on social media saying that more and more what is really looking is that this is a an all - out campaign by Benjamin Netanyahu at the behest of the most radically far- government in Israel 's modern history to displace massive amounts of Palestinians . Since the ceasefire broke down , we 've had over 400,000 Palestinians displaced . Displaced is a euphemism for uprooted from their homes , forced to go elsewhere , elsewhere where they really do n't have any security or safety to displace them to essentially de facto put into effect a demographic shift . Now what Vulkar Turk the human rights commissioner says he has said that this is equivalent to ethnic cleansing . He has used the term I believe on several occasions ethnic cleansing . And it 's it 's it 's a term that has also been evoked by others . Obviously , Israel vehemently denies anything of the sort . They will continually to tell you this is a military operation aimed at rooting out Hamas militants and defeating Hamas remains their arch imperative operational objective . The fact remains after 19 months of war , Hamas remains very much empowered . It 's not going away . And critics of this military strategy by Israel say that if anything it is going to have the perverse effect of reinforcing Hamas , making it double down and also stoking the anger and resentment of a whole new generation that has borne the brunt of this war along with millions of other Palestinian civilians bearing the brunt of this military assault . So the objectives , , defeat Hamas , , get the hostages out . But a lot of the critics and those who are pushing back against that official narrative say that is just so many words , Jenny . , and this even this week , , Netanyahu gives a little grist to the mill of those critics when he says things , and I have the quote here . , he said earlier this week , , "" We are destroying more and more homes . "" He 's talking about homes in the Gaza Strip . They have nowhere to return to , they being Palestinian civilians . the only inevitable outcome will be the desire of Gazins to immigrate outside of the Gaza Strip . If that sounds familiar , it 's because it echoes almost to the word to the letter what Donald Trump has said , his vision of he called Gaza demolition site , wants to relocate all 2.3 million Palestinians outside of the script so that he could create a freedom zone so that he could create what he called the Riviera of the Middle East . Now , ceasefire talks have resumed in Qatar and Arab League summit in Baghdad is calling for a truce and funding to rebuild Gaza . What do we know about that ? , we know that these are talks happening in Baghdad . They seem from the perspective of what 's going on now in the skies above Gaza and the reality of the grounds where Israeli troops are , , getting into formation reportedly along the borders , , with some ground invasion imminent again to seize more territory of Gaza beyond the zones already seized . All of that , the parallel talks in Baghdad with the Arab League , with Mahmud Abbas , the Palestinian Authority leader in Tenton , they want a ceasefire . this is what they 've been calling for a while . And they also want a reconstruction plan for Gaza . Not a reconstruction plan as Donald Trump and perhaps Netanyahu sees it , but mostly Donald Trump , the Riviera of the Middle East with hotels and casinos being built in lie of Palestinians living there and millions of homes . what they 're looking for is reconstruction of the strip , long - term reconstruction . Egypt 's president is there too . A withdrawal of all Israeli troops . This was the original condition here . But that is not the way things have been going over the over the past few months . Since Israel abandoned essentially renounced the two - month ceasefire in mid - March , we 've had what seems a march more and more toward towards a concerted military offensive aimed at cracking down and removing civilians from Gaza through whatever means necessary , even if that 's not explicitly stated as the military objective at this point . Doug , thank you very much indeed ."

https://youtu.be/4Z3hMvHg8Mg?si=r3_PhU-7_tODJPZR,How do Indians feel about the ceasefire between India and Pakistan?,France 24 English,4Z3hMvHg8Mg,"It 's been one week since India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire , ending their most serious military confrontation in decades . The truce , which was announced by US President Donald Trump , was agreed rapidly last weekend after several days of fighting . India and Pakistan agreed to extend it at least until this Sunday . For the very latest , we can cross to New Delhi and check in with our correspondent Navodita Kumari . Navadita , this ceasefire was shaky at first , but it 's held for about a week now . Can you just walk us through what 's been happening ? , absolutely . Just after the announcement of this ceasefire , there were lot of doubts and un certainity whether this ceasefire will hold . remember it all started after on May 7th , India said that it allegedly struck at least nine terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan in response to a terrorist attack in Pahelgam in Indian administered Kashmir in which at least 26 people were killed mostly tourists and after that in retaliation Pakistan also launched drone and missile attacks and we saw 3 days of intense fighting and military escalation between these two nuclear armed neighbors and for Pakistan that they simultaneously launched strikes in at least two dozen places in India not just in Jammu and Kashmir but beyond in the states of Punjab , Hana , Rajasthan and Gujarat . So after these three days of intense military escalation , the whole world was waiting for some deescalation which came after first we heard from Donald Trump who announced it on social media saying that he has negotiated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan . Of course , Pakistan on their side said that three dozen countries were involved in reaching this deal while India has rejected that claim and said that it was the director general of military operations of Pakistan that contacted its India his Indian counterpart and it was decided mutually and bilaterally that they will seize military actions towards each other . But Trump in the past week has at least five to six times said that it was him and the US that helped in broken this truce which has not gone well with the Indian government . And Navita , how do Indians feel about this ceasefire ? I understand that there 's some division . , clearly how Indians feel depends on where you are . for those people living near the border areas where they saw intense shelling and destruction and also at least 16 civilians were killed and dozens of civilians were also injured in the fighting between the two countries . They welcome this decision of a ceasefire . But a lot of supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , a lot of Hindu -wing supporters are not happy with this decision . They see that and they were expecting from Modi who see him as a strong man who is there to protect their religion . Remember it all started after the terrorist attack in Pahelgam and allegedly there the terrorists were asking the religion of the people before killing them . So it had created a lot of anger and reactions amongst Indians and so all these supporters of Modi they say that India clearly had an advantage military advantage over Pakistan . So why did India surrender to the seas and they see that and there are very aggressive response to this not just on social media some anonymous voices but when we were reporting from Jammu we spoke with dozens of people and majority of them they had this feeling that if this had started this conflict had started the Indian government should have there were some really aggressive statements Pakistan should have been completely wiped off from the map of the world and this there should be a full and final solution to the Pakistan problem . So for those people they are really angry frustrated and there has been growing also sentiments towards China because they say that China 's supplied arms and weapons to Pakistan which was used against India and also Turkey because allegedly Turkey made drones were found being used by Pakistan on India . So there is a whole range of emotions because historically Pakistan has been a very sensitive and emotional issue for Indians and there has been a historical resentment towards its neighbor and India Indians they do n't trust Pakistan . So whether it 's a cricket match between these two nuclear armed rivals or it 's a full - fledged conflict or war , there is very charged up emotions amongst Indians against Pakistan . All , a lot of charged emotions . We 'll have to see if that ceasefire continues to hold . Navodita , thank you so much for that update . That 's our correspondent Navodita Kumari reporting there from New Delhi ."
https://youtu.be/Im9AMpufMp8?si=xt6gSO6Ij3xW9M0I,Israel kills hundreds in 'initial stages' of its new Gaza operation,France 24 English,Im9AMpufMp8,"Israel 's military has killed hundreds of people in what it calls the opening moves of Operation Gideon 's chariots . Thousands of Palestinians have been ordered by Israeli forces to flee parts of northern Gaza . Since Thursday alone , extensive air strikes and have killed over 250 men , women , and children . The stated goal of the new offensive is for the Israeli military to achieve operational control in Gaza . its troops seizing this new territory in a fresh effort to force Hamas to release the remaining hostages . Now , Hamas still holds 57 of about 250 hostages seized in its October 2023 attack on Israel , which resulted in the death of about 1,200 people , mostly civilians . For more , let 's speak to our correspondent Noatolski . Let you , this past week , there was hope that Donald Trump 's M East tour would bring a ceasefire . That was not the case . There were calls of famine and starvation in Gaza continuing to go unheated . And now instead of any prospect of ending the fighting on both sides , it looks things could get a lot worse . It does every single thing that you said . In fact , one of the dramatic moments this week that a little bit seems to have fallen under the radar is that the president of the United States himself while declining to visit Israel and not having meetings with any Israelis while he was here in the region , he himself confirmed . He said , , "" A lot of people are starving in Gaza . "" So , we now know that this is the official position of the United States . The Israeli government has simply not reacted to any of this . And regarding the military operation , so far it has been kept mostly to these massive air strikes that you 're describing , but again we 're in a situation in which the Israeli army at least appears to want to eat its cake and have it too . So it is describing this expanding operation as ongoing preparations . It says it wants to hold , grab and hold more territory in Gaza as part of preparations for what it describes as this massive ground operation that it is planning . I do know that more and more reservers are getting callup orders , but we 're not in that operation just yet . Apparently , it could more formally be launched really at any hour . . And I 'm curious about the timing . Only 5 days ago , Donald Trump secured the release of the hostage American Israeli Eden Alexander . So , so why is this offensive going to be launched ? Why now ? , simply put , Hamas demands in exchange for the release of all the remaining 58 hostages that Israel declare an end to the war . And equally simply put , Israel refuses to declare an end to the war so long as Hamas exists . So the very circumstances of this week in which for the first time in history a senior US official Steve Witco Donald Trump 's old friend and senior envoy for all conflicts on earth sat and met apparently so we 've heard directly with these terrorists Islamist terrorists representing Hamas . The fact that he met them allowed Israel to say they still exist and so we refuse to declare an end to the war . Of course , within Israel , the explanations are , I would say , much darker . And the families of these remaining hostages and many others , thousands and thousands of Israelis who are protesting against this war every day , say that the prime minister refuses to declare or accept an end to the war because he needs the war to continue in order to keep his cabinet on side in order to guarantee that he stays in power despite his lack of popularity . There have been really shattering accusations this week from family members of numerous hostages . Among those few , the 20 or 21 or so known for sure to still be alive , that Prime Minister Netanyahu prefers them dead to the risk of signing any agreement . I want to add one more thing . The other accusation , of course , is what we know from military sources here in Israel that the only way to truly get rid of Hamas that is very degraded at this point is to replace it with another entity , the Palestinian Authority , a pan - Arab force , something . And Israel , the Israeli government has refused all configurations for any entity that might replace Hamas . So on the one hand , they wo n't replace Hamas . And on the other hand , they say that while Hamas exists , they wo n't declare an end to the war . That is where things are stuck now ."

Let 's bring in Sven Biscott , director of the Europe in the world program . to you Sven . Vladimir Putin not the only absence there . It also seems Europe left on the sidelines . , Trump has said from the beginning that he does not want to involved the European Union or European states u in the talks . So in a way it 's not a surprise . But in fact we have an impact on those negotiations or seeming negotiations because we have also taken a firm position through the EU through the coalition of the willing . We have said we will continue the accession process of Ukraine to join the EU . We will maintain our sanctions against Russia . We will continue to arm Ukraine even after a potential agreement . So there will be no demilitarization . And if there is a ceasefire , we will deploy European troops to Ukraine . for facts that Trump does not control , can not negotiate away in favor of Putin . And so we do have an impact . And what if Washington is at odds with these European positions and Zalinski ends up perhaps making some of the concessions that would be against European interests . We of course consult closely with Ukraine . That 's precisely the strength also of the European position and that is I think what enables Zalinski suerv to act knowing that he is still backed at least by his European allies . , we 've seen these meetings the coalition of the willing taking place in several European cities . might they need to move somewhere else perhaps cross the Atlantic and try to get the Trump administration to listen to what they 're saying ? This is what for example President Mako and Prime Minister Stalmer have done . The point is the Americans themselves have asked for European troops to be deployed but then they refuse to guarantee their security if that would lead to a war with Russia . Of course , imagine that this scenario happens . There 's a ceasefire . European troops all from NATO countries are shed by Russia and the United States stays out of it . That day the US de facto leaves NATO . Whether the Americans wanted or not , NATO is involved . But it would be much better for the strength of the coalition , the credibility of the security guarantee that they want to offer to Ukraine if Trump would say it very explicitly . . And what do you make of these talks in Istanbul ? Vladimir Putin chooses the place . He chooses the date . there 's anticipation the first talks in three years between Ukraine and Russia , but then he does n't show up . It feels anticlimatic and it feels either in the best case scenario he 's buying time , the worst case scenario he 's manipulating negotiators . Indeed . , I think Zalinsky played it well by going so he can clearly demonstrate that he 's not to fault if this does n't result in anything . And I guess we can only conclude that indeed Putin is not yet ready to negotiate because as your correspondent said militarily he thinks he is winning at a tremendous cost though . So I do n't exclude that at some point Russia might still seek at least a temporary agreement depending on what Trump is willing to offer to Putin . The risk is of course that Trump seems to want to end this war not for the sake of Ukraine but for the sake of his own relationship with Russia . And so Trump might be willing to offer concessions that would go against the Ukrainian and therefore against the European interests . Hence it 's so crucial that the Europeans stick to their guns and figuratively and continue their position in support of in close consultation with Ukraine . What would Vladimir Putin have to do or say to get a negotiations with Europe present with Zilinsky president a face - to - face talk that brings the EU to the table ? What would he have to do before Europe is ready to take that step ? , I think if Putin wants to engage in sincere negotiations directly with Ukraine , , what if Ukraine agrees to go to the table , Europe will certainly support that . That 's not the issue . The issue is that as long as the war continues , we must make clear that no matter how long it continues , we will never drop Ukraine . And I think that is what Putin also has to understand . and he may think time is on his side but we have now said that Ukraine will be a member of the European Union . Therefore come what may Europe will never drop Ukraine . So there will be no there is no prospect of complete victory for Russia either . That is what our stance makes clear . Sven thank you so much . Sven Biscott from the Royal Institute for International Relations in Brussels . Pierce ."
https://youtu.be/N_URT9YQ0eg?si=vpNjUSjl12h2Tu4K,Iran-Europe nuclear talks in Istanbul with Trump’s shadow looming,France 24 English,N_URT9YQ0eg,"After the US president said a nuclear deal with Iran was getting close . Thrron holding a talks with Britain , France , and Germany in Turkey this Friday . The meeting follows Iran 's Foreign Minister Abbas Aragshi 's warning of irreversible consequences if the European powers move to reimpose United Nation sanctions on Iran that were lifted under a 2015 deal . For more , let 's speak to our foreign editor , Philip Tur . to you , , Philip . first point of questioning getting close , close . What does that mean ? It 's Donald Trump 's usual way of being not too clear about what is going on . If you look at the statement from Donald Trump , we 're in very serious negotiations with Iran for long - term peace . We 're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran . I think we 're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this , meaning go to conflict with Iran . What he 's saying is come to the negotiating table , sign that deal , get it out of the way , and then we will lift sanctions . If you do n't do that , then we will start preparing a military strike on Iran , which has been backed by Israel , which is why Israel and the United States do n't really see eye to eye over the way that Iran should be dealt with . the United States under Donald Trump trying to work out some an agreement over Iran 's nuclear deterrent . So that 's the way things are now . Now that there are more discussions planned this weekend , a fifth round of negotiation between US and Iranian negotiators . We do n't know how those are going to take place . And what Iran has been saying , our correspondent earlier this morning on France 24 was saying that the Iranians have n't received a document . The US say they 've handed over with the outline of those discussions in it . But maybe Qatar , which acts as a mediator in all of this between Iran and the United States , which has done so for many years , may come up with that plan ahead of those discussions on Sunday . so we do n't know where this is all going to go . , what is going on is , you sign the deal to dismantle your nuclear deterrent and the United States will lift sanctions as a result of that and at the same time we will move forward and there wo n't be any military strikes on Iran . That is what is being offered on the table by the Americans . It sounds similar to what we already had back in 2015 . and Donald Trump pulling out of that nuclear deal then . Is he going to get anything better ? , that is the question that no one can answer now . That was back in 2018 that the United States pulled out of the deal . Remember that Donald Trump said that was one of the worst deals that he 'd ever seen . and that 's why he was going to reimpose much stricter sanctions on Iran back in back in 2015 when that original deal was signed . It was the United States , France , the UK , EU , Russia , China , and Germany who signed up to it . they agreed to an end to enriching uranium only to 367 % for a period of 15 years and to eliminate uranium stockpile for 13 years . Now , when it comes down to the agreement this time round , Iran has made it pretty clear that the United States request that uranium enrichment ceases completely is something that 's a red line as far as they 're concerned . So where they 're going to draw that line afterwards in order to reach that agreement is still unclear now . So Donald Trump may come away with something equivalent , maybe not quite as good , but depending on Donald Trump , you can be sure that he 's going to try to sell this as the deal of the century . , because he says , "" Look , we 've already signed a deal with the Houthi rebels . They 're an Iranian proxy group to stop them from firing missiles on ships . we 're also trying to do away with Hezbollah , stop their bases being constructed in Syria following that meeting between Donald Trump and the new Syrian president . So there is more to this than just that . But when push comes to shove , it 's difficult to see how there 's going to be a deal there that 's going to satisfy everybody and we still do n't really know where this is all going to work out this weekend . Now you mentioned earlier on very briefly that there were going to be talks going on this weekend between well starting today between France the United Kingdom and Iran over the sanctions that were lifted in 2015 when this deal was originally signed . that was for a 10 - year period . That period is going to end with what is called termination day on October the 18th . So Iran is under pressure to try to come up with some an agreement with those countries so those sanctions are not reimposed after that date because that would be a huge hindrance for Thran . And one other point that I think is key which is good to underline is that we do n't know really what sanctions Donald Trump is talking about . Are they sanctions just imposed since 2018 by the United States or are they all sanctions which also include for example sanctions over human rights abuses in Iran . So that also is something that we do n't know the answer to now . All , Philip , thank you very much ."

Say , what more do we know about a potential deal between Iran and the US ? , Allison , , Donald Trump is correct about having serious negotiations with Iran . But being too close to have an agreement is wishful thinking I would say at the very best because now we receiving reports from Washington that the United States presented Iran in the fourth arm talks last week in Oman with a with a document regarding its suggestions and its solutions reaching an agreement . Now the Iranian foreign minister said yesterday that it has not the Iranian delegation has not received a document as such but he did not rule out that during the coming days maybe the this document will be presented by the Omani foreign ministry to the Iranian delegation . So when the differences are this big and this massive I would say that reaching an is saying that we are too close to reach an agreement now . This is visual thinking at the very best and the two sides have not yet even agreed on having a fifth round of talks . So the latest we have is that the Iranian foreign minister said we 're ready to clarify about the nuclear program of the Iranian government . We are ready to build trust , but we 're not ready to give up on our enrichment , and it is an in inalienable . , so sounds some grandstanding optimism then from Donald Trump . Meanwhile , Iran is also holding talks with three European nations this Friday . What what can we expect to come out of those ? the Iranian deputy foreign minister for political affairs Majani will be heading to Istanbul today to hold talks with as you said the Europe European troa but now in Iran we 're hearing that Germany has declined to attend the meeting fairly because the government the German government is new and has n't been able to clarify its point its standing position on this matter for now . the new German foreign minister said that he is looking forward to having it having talks with the Iranian foreign minister Abbasi over the phone but it is unclear whether Germany would attend and the Iranians believe that the European troa have alienated themselves from these talks by being passive and somehow passive aggressive in the words of the foreign minister . So , , we just hope that everything would go well . All , we 'll be watching closely . Say , thank you so much for that . That 's Sed Azimi , our correspondent there , reporting from Thrron ."
https://youtu.be/34sea4o9Jvs?si=Bd7gXrG0Sd3FkL5c,Putin's choice of sending Medinsky reinforces idea this is a continuation of failed talks in 2022',France 24 English,34sea4o9Jvs,", for some reaction and analysis , we can bring in Gavin Hall , a teaching fellow in political science and international security at the University of Strathclyde and a specialist on NATO . Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today . Just first , what do you make of the drama that we saw in the leadup to these talks ? . , good morning . , part of it may be drama , but I always think it would be slightly unlikely that Vladimir Putin would have attended these talks himself . I think he 's probably more in a position whereby he wants to be coming in at the end when a deal 's all agreed or anything if that is even the case . Let 's not forget after all in Putin 's mindset this is n't a war or a conflict . It 's a special military operation . so for him to be wanting to be this great world leader on a par with Donald Trump and re reimagining his superpower status a leader of that nature would n't sully themselves with the early rounds of negotiations if you that would be left to aid . So I 'm was n't surprised that Putin has n't attended these talks even though he did grant them . His choice of sending Vladimir Madinsky though is interesting because it reinforces this idea that this is a continuation of the failed talks in 2022 rather than a new round of negotiations which I think tells us something about the nature of demands that are going to be included within the discussion . very specifically those focus a lot on trying to ensure the neutrality of Ukraine going forward and is quite restrictive in terms of future Ukrainian military capacity and also sovereignty . So I do n't think this the setup is necessarily one that 's going to be conducive to having some form of actual positive agreement at the end of it . . The expectations are very low going into these talks . Trump said there 'd be no progress , we heard him there , on Ukraine until he and Putin can meet face to face . What would that meeting change ? It seems that it could not possibly bode very well for Vladimir Zalinski . , this is it . He 's left in a position whereby to in order for the talks to continue , he is to effectively be offering some form of concession . And I think this is very much part of the Russian strategy is trying to maneuver Silinski , Ukraine and its European supporters into a position whereby they give something up in order to try and get the progress going . I know late yesterday or overnight the Russian media outlet Medusa was putting forward news articles and stories that are seen as effectively trying to help prepare Russians for the mindset that the war is going to continue for a longer period of time . So you have these dual messages coming out of Moscow . On the one hand , , we 're preparing for a longer conflict , but also we want to have some form of negotiation . So , effectively , it 's trying to put the maximum possible pressure on Vladimir Silinski and Ukraine . And they 're effectively saying , "" What are you prepared to give up ? What are you ? "" And trying to put the pressure on Ukraine to make the first offers of concessions rather than Russia making concessions . And that seems to be the main sticking point and the general parameter that these negotiations are taking place within . Is Putin 's strategy not risky though ? , could n't he anger Donald Trump who really wants to be able to claim a victory here ? He he could anger Donald Trump and we know I think it 's fair to say that President Trump 's dealings have been somewhat erratic . whether this is rowing back on tariffs , trade deals , , , or even foreign policy matters . So , , it 's certainly possible he could get angered . But Trump also , he said this war could be solved in day one as part of his election campaign . He 's put some degree of political capital into trying to get it solved , but he is moving forward on , foreign policy things . We also hear this morning apparently a nuclear deal with Iran might be on the cards . the Israel Hamas conflict was brought to a close . So Donald Trump is trying to put forth that he is achieving foreign policy objectives and aims that President Biden was unable to do . So he 's unlikely to be that angered by a by a no great success in these talks because it also helps him . It elevates that I 'm I 'm the great deal maker . These talks ca n't happen unless I 'm there and I can only be there if there is n't Putin 's there . So it reinforces his own sense of importance if you . , expectations certainly low but we will be following those talks . thank you Gavin Hall again so much for speaking with us . That was Gavin Hall , a teaching fellow in political science and international security at the University of Strathclyde ."

The Times have found us to protect our Constitution . If Nancy Pelosi is demonstrating with dozens of others in front of the Supreme Court , it 's to show that it 's a serious issue . When I was born in this country , my mom was undocumented . So if Donald Trump and Republicans got their way , I would be erased out of our nation 's history . The definition of birthight . As soon as he returned to the White House in January , Donald Trump signed one of the most controversial executive orders of his new term , an order to automatically exclude children born to parents who are in the US illegally or in temporary visas . The nine Supreme Court judges met on Thursday to look at the issue because several federal courts have suspended the president 's order on the grounds that it violates the 14th amendment , which says that all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside . On his social network , the American president drove his point home . Birthright citizenship was not meant for people taking vacations to become permanent citizens of the United States of America and bringing their families with them all the time laughing at the suckers that we are . But beyond this issue , it 's the balance of power that 's at stake . The Trump administration was n't specifically asking the Supreme Court to look at the wider issue on Thursday , but rather to limit the ability of the lower courts to block his policy nationwide . What has made the US the country that it is this check and balances where you will have at least one branch be able to check on the other one . But if you have and continue to have a situation where they 're just validating anything the executive does , then it will continue to strip the rights of any everyday American in the US . The Supreme Court decision is expected to be handed down in June ."

We can cross now to Istanbul and check in with our correspondent Jasper Mortimer . Jasper , tell us exactly what is scheduled for today . , at midday today , the Ukrainian and the Russian and the Turkish delegations are due to sit down together . the Ukrainian delegation will be led by their defense minister , Rustam Umarov . The Russian delegation will be led by an advisor to Vladimir Putin . His name is Vladimir Malinski . He 's a historian who has taken a hard line on Ukraine . He believes it should not exist as an independent nation . The talks will open with an address by the Turkish foreign minister Hakan Sidan which is expected to be broadcast live . however before that about 3 hours from now the Ukrainians will have a meeting with the Americans and with the Turks and the American delegation is expected to be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Jasper is anything expected to come out of these talks at this point ? Very little . Marco Rubio said yesterday , "" We do n't have high expectations of what will happen . "" He added , "" The only way we 're going to have a breakthrough is between President Trump and President Putin . "" And I read that comment to mean that he believes that only President Trump can bring Putin to the peace table . Now , if you accept that Putin does n't want peace talks at this stage , and there 's good reason to believe that , on the battlefield , the Russian forces are winning slowly but steadily , and world support for Ukraine is falling and Ukraine faces the imminent prospect of a cut off of American military aid . So , time is on Russia 's side . and certainly this whole exercise in u Istanbul would appear to have been one big success for Putin because he sent to Istanbul a delegation headed by a low - level official who does n't have the power to make decisions the decisions necessary for a peace settlement . All , so very low expectations . We 'll be following those talks though nonetheless . Jasper , thank you so much"

There 's been an Israeli blockade on aid since March 2nd , and it 's left civilians there starving . Both UNICEF and the World Food Program say that famine is looming in Gaza . , the new proposal appears to be an Israeli idea that is fronted by a USbacked charity . The charity will enlist the help of private security contractors to execute a delivery in Gaza . Israel said that this plan will be enacted by the end of the month . But this is all extremely controversial . Why ? , because it will use two private security firms based here in the United States . One is called Safe Reach Solutions and it 's led by the former head of the CIA 's paramilitary arm , who also has links to the company that ran notorious private security firm Blackwater . And the other is called UG Solutions , and it 's run by a former US special forces soldier . The plan also involves emptying the north of Gaza . The aid hubs will be in the south and forcing Garzans not to go back to where they came from in exchange for receiving aid . , the UN has rejected this plan , saying that it weaponizes aid and threatens to cause the mass displacement of Palestinians . The EU 's former chief diplomat , Joseph Burell , has gone a step further . He has accused Israel of ethnic cleansing and of using the starvation of Gaza 's civilian population as a weapon of war . , the call from the United Nations is just let us do our work . Just let us deliver aid to civilians in need in Gaza . It 's important to point out that the UN can deliver aid effectively as it did during the recent ceasefire and according to humanitarian law if Israel would only allow it to . , Israel 's envoy to the UN , Danny Denon , has said that the idea of this new aid model is that Hamas will not be able to take advantage of humanitarian aid . So , that 's Israel 's argument . But the problem with this Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation plan for many at the United Nations is that they see it as a trap . Whilst it might be called humanitarian , they believe that its actual objective is not humanitarian at all . It 's political and military . , British Ambassador to the UN , Barbara Woodward , had a clear message for Israel from EU members of the Security Council . Earlier on this week , she said , "" Lift the blockade on aid and enable the United Nations and humanitarians to save lives . "" She said that any model for distributing aid must be independent , impartial , and neutral , and in line , of course , with humanitarian law . She said , "" , we ca n't support any model that places political or military objectives above the needs of civilians . "" However , it 's unclear what the EU or the UN can do to stop this new plan from being pushed forward by Israel and the United"
https://youtu.be/Fva75lpVims?si=XCLymYukQRNFp_uo,"No, Saudi TV did not cover up Trump’s ‘coffee snub’ using AI",France 24 English,Fva75lpVims,", coming up next then is our truth or fake segment and for that I am joined here by Catalina Marshant Debu . Hi Catalina . So we 're going to stay with Donald Trump 's trip to the Middle East for this segment . You 're starting with that viral video where the US president refused to drink coffee offered to him in Saudi Arabia which of course spoke sparked some conspiracy theories online . Tell us more . That 's , Arian . Here 's the viral video where Donald Trump appears not to drink the coffee he was offered during a royal welcome ceremony in Saudi Arabia while meeting Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman . A tradition in Saudi society where coffee is offered to guests upon their arrival as a symbol of welcome and respect . This user says Trump refused to drink the coffee . Why do you think he did this ? A gesture that drew backlash online . Many calling it a snub , as in the Arab world . According to local etiquette , refusing coffee is considered disrespectful . A rude American , this user says lots of speculation around this matter . This user considers perhaps an assassination attempt , he says , could be possible poison . Secret Service tells him not to consume anything given to him without being tested . while others say Trump does not trust the Saudis . Then there was further speculation where when this viral video was started circulating online where we see a published by East European outlet Next OnX claiming that Saudi state channel Alabia used AI to fix this apparent coffee snub and aired this edited version highlighted in red on the top where we see Donald Trump sipping on the coffee versus the prior version that we showed underneath in green where he is not drinking the coffee . This user says , "" Next , what an embarrassment . A Saudi TV channel edited Trump 's video using AI to smooth out , they say , Trump 's manners he in the edited video , Trump is shown drinking the coffee offered him , while in reality he declined the drink . "" A theory of course further amplified by Russian state media and linked accounts such as Ministry of Truth on Telegram or Life News with a t the title that reads Saudi Arabian TV channel changes Trump 's manners using AI . So Catalina , what do we know about that alleged alteration to the video ? Is it truth or fake ? Erin , these claims are fake . There is no sufficient evidence to support this claim that the footage aired by Saudi state television was edited using artificial intelligence to allegedly , they say , smooth out Trump 's manners or lack of thereof . Instead , the video appears to show two different occasions in which the president was offered coffee . As this user says , these are two different occasions and places . to the first one when Trump does n't drink the coffee is in the airport during the welcome ceremony while the second one where he does drink the coffee is in the royal court or the royal palace hours after Trump 's arrival . So if we take a closer look at the screenshot of this moment you can indeed compare both and realize that there are different backgrounds indicating different situations elements missing in the version aired in by Saudi TV . for instance , this flower vase or this painting that we see as well as the flags that are surrounding the leaders . However , a video that was tricky enough since they 're both shown in tight frames , clips that can easily be taken out of context as they just were . Aaron , so it appears , Catalina , that Donald Trump 's what knowledge about his own habits would contribute to provide offering some light on this story . Does the US president drink coffee ? That 's . There is a reason for Trump 's viral coffee snub . It 's a widely known fact that President Donald Trump does not drink coffee except when he is campaigning . According to this 2017 article from Newsweek , a claim supported by multiple sources over the years . He avoids coffee , tea , alcohol , and drugs , citing a personal preference and family history such as his brother 's Fred struggles and subsequent death due to alcoholism . per this interview he granted Esquire magazine in 2015 . So it 's rare instances where we see Donald Trump sipping on coffee here perhaps Versailles in 2016 and the images we just saw from Saudi Arabia where Trump is definitely being put to the test . But how does Trump survive without coffee ? You may ask . The New York Times reported in 2017 that instead of coffee , the president drinks Diet Coke , reportedly ingesting up to a dozen Diet Cokes per day . So , no coffee , but a Diet Coke addiction where they report that during his first term , he had a red button on his Oval Office desk that if pressed , summons an assistant to deliver or will summon the drink . We 'll have to verify this information with our Washington correspondent Frasier Daxon to see if this is true . the second time around . Dozen Diet Coke sounds a heavy quantities of a diuretic . I imagine that 's probably accompanied by at least a dozen or more trips to the bathroom . Catalina Marshante Abrau ."

Why ? , I think that Vladimir Putin realized that he just would n't look good in comparison with the Ukrainian president was a master of such showdowns . he would I think seriously upstage the Russian president and Putin is very wary of ever looking weak or not up to standards and he 's frankly paranoid about such encounters . do n't forget also that Putin has for the duration of this war proclaimed Zilinski as illegitimate especially lately as Zilinski 's nominal first term has run out and there we can not have new elections simply because the constitution does not allow for holding of elections during peace time . Vladimir Putin has boxed himself in with his rhetoric to where now to appear next to Zilinski would diminish him as he thinks in front of his elites and his people . also I think the fact that Trump would be willing to travel there and put pressure by being there on these talks and on Vladimir Putin that also automatically puts Putin between a rock and a hard place because by all indications if he has to be Vladimir Putin is not genuinely willing to sit down and talk . He feels time is on his side . He feels there 's a momentum on the front lines in Russia 's favor and therefore he is not really willing to wrap this up anytime soon . Indeed . And yet here we have one president at least the Ukrainian president Vladimir Zilinski who is at these talks in Turkey today . He 's going to be meeting a Russian delegation which he 's said is not adequate to be discussing with him . So given all of that , what 's the point of having these talks at all ? for the Ukrainian side this is to show to send a signal to Donald Trump that they 're serious about this . The Ukrainian side simply can not afford to look the recalcitrant unwilling party after what we saw at the white house at the oval office . You remember that economous meeting and so the Ukrainians are also playing within a very narrow space here . And Ukraine has , I think , done all it could and I think it 's played its cards quite masterfully when it comes to the talks in Turkey . So the ball is Vladimir Putin 's court very much so . And , you did mean the level you did talk about the level of the Russian delegation . I could I would n't say anything other than they sent a clown . Again , I 'm sorry , but the gentleman who also led the talks three years ago . His name is Medinski . He 's originally from Ukraine . He is a not a very serious player . He 's way below down the chain of command in the Russian hierarchy . He 's a minister of culture . He 's a jingoist . He is known to be quite a an unserious character . , he likes Joseph Stalin and all these things . So just on the look of it , the Russians did n't even send Lavrov the foreign minister . This is a very clear signal what Vladimir Putin thinks about Trump 's peace initiatives . Indeed . And we even heard from Sergey Lavrov who described Vladimir Zilinsky as pitiful just a few moments ago . So given all of this , given the fact that it seems we are indeed at this impass , what 's the way forward ? , the way forward is for Donald Trump to reestablish transatlantic unity to , , to get on the same page with the Europeans and put forward a unified front when it comes to Russia . All the talk of sanctions we 've heard from the European leaders , Trump has to match that rhetoric . There has to be a concerted plan of action , new sanctions , and more weapons for Ukraine . And so , are you optimistic at all that will happen ? It will have to happen . And I think there 's a good chance that finally we 're going to we 're going to see some Republican congressmen rediscover their spine and talk some sense into Donald Trump that it 's time to stand by our allies and stop looking weak before Vladimir Putin . All , Peter , thank you for that . Peter Zamev , the director of the Eurasia Democracy Initiative in Kev ."

A report published by Human Rights Watch has warned of a surge of deaths of migrant construction workers in the Gulf country as it prepares to host one of the world 's biggest sports competitions . Workers have fallen from heights , been electrocuted and even crushed or decapitated by heavy machinery . According to the NGO , heat related illnesses are also a major concern . The report says many deaths are wrongly classified as having occurred due to natural causes and that the families of workers are not compensated . In interviews with the families of 31 workers from Bangladesh , India and Nepal , many recount the struggle they faced to repatriate the bodies of their loved ones . Initially , the people from the company proposed to bury my husband 's body in Saudi Arabia and assured us of various company facilities in return . But when we wanted to bring my husband 's body to Bangladesh and bury him here , the company said that we will have to bear all the expenses of bringing the body . Human Rights Watch is calling on Saudi authorities to ensure basic safety protections for the country 's huge migrant workforce , which is now rushing to build 11 new stadiums , a rail and transit network , and 185,000 hotel rooms in time for 2034 . Saudi authorities are yet to comment . The oil richch Gulf nation was handed the to host the World Cup in December . Saudi Arabia despite concerns for its human rights record , conditions for migrant laborers , and criminalization of same - sex relationships . The same concerns were raised ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . While difficult to estimate , it 's believed that more than 6,500 migrant workers died in the buildup to the tournament , though Doha said it recorded only 37 migrant worker deaths during that period ."

Jasper , good afternoon to you . What do we know about these negotiations where you are ? Who is attending ? , the Russians have sent a delegation to Istanbul . It 's led by an adviser to President Vladimir Putin called Vladimir Malinski . and his second man is a deputy Russian foreign minister . But these people do not have decision - making powers . They have n't come to Dormabachi Palace , which is 100 meters over there to the left of me . because the Ukrainians have n't pitched up there . So talks which were due to start in Dolma Palace 6 hours ago have not even begun . The delegations have n't arrived . The Ukrainians have not announced who would be in their delegation . But the Ukrainians have President Vladimir Zalinski in Ankura . He 's been talking to Turkish President Richard Ty Erdogan . And they have their foreign minister Andre Sabha in Antalya who 's been attending the NATO foreign minister 's meeting there . Now those two men could fly to Istanbul within an hour but they 're unwilling to come to the table unless their Russian interlocas have the power to make the decisions necessary for a peace deal . Jasper NATO foreign ministers as you mentioned are meeting in Antalya . What 's happening there ? they do have a plan on the table . Work is being done there . the foreign ministers are doing the hard work for a NATO summit to take place in the Netherlands in about six weeks time . Now , US President Donald Trump wants the member states of the 32 member NATO to increase their spending on defense to 5 % of GDP . And it 's been pointed out that the Americans do n't spend 5 % of their GDP on defense . however the NATO secretary general Mark Rutter has come up with a plan so that the member states increase their spending on defense gradually over the next seven years to 3.5 % . They 'll reach that at 2032 and then they will spend another one and a half% on military related projects such as building roads and railways so that their troops can move around their countries more quickly to meet President Trump 's target of 5 % . that is the compromise that they 've come up with to keep everybody happy . I should point out that the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Antalya and it is thought that he would fly to Istanbul if he saw any purpose in bashing heads together between the Russians and the Ukrainians to get a deal . But as these talks have n't even started , one ca n't see Marco Rubio coming here . Jasper , thank you very much for that . Jasper Mortimer reporting there for us from Istanbul ."

Its new report points to illegal weapons transfers , fresh attacks on civilians and Ugan troops operating in a country without UN approval . Olivia Bizu has the story . South Sudan has been under a UN arms embargo since 2018 after a peace deal ended five years of brutal civil war . But in recent months , fighting has flared again between government forces and the White Army , a militia group linked to first vice president Ryek Mashar . Ugandan troops have since been deployed to support the government . And according to Amnesty International , that deployment breaches the embargo because neither Uganda nor South Sudan informed the UN sanctions committee or requested an exemption . But despite these violations , Amnesty is urging the UN Security Council to renew the embargo before it expires . Whilst the arms embargo that was imposed on South Sudan in 2018 has not been a panacea to the human rights situation , we do feel that it would be a lot worse without it in place . Our concern is that if the UN Security Council does not renew and enforce the arms embargo when it is up for renewal at the end of this month , we worry that the floodgates u would open , that parties to the conflict in South Sudan would acquire more weapons , more heavy weapons and that those would be used to target civilians . Amnesty is also raising concerns about South Sudan 's use of attack helicopters . They point to satellite images that show military flights in recent months and say this likely means the government is breaking the embargo , which bans the import of spare parts . But it 's not just governments . Private companies are involved , too . One airline admitted to flying Ugandan troops and weapons into South Sudan in March . Amnesty warns that without stricter enforcement , these weapons could be used to target more civilians and intensify the situation on the ground ."
https://youtu.be/NKX_vJE56Xg?si=O8JjFYjdrGrihfpW,Kyiv has low expectations for talks in Istanbul to end war with Russia,France 24 English,NKX_vJE56Xg,"after keeping everybody waiting for a long time as to whether or not Vladimir Putin might go to Turkey has announced a delegation for these talks that is not even at the level of the foreign minister . It will be the deputy foreign minister and an adviser to Putin . The Ukrainians have n't responded in saying who they would send to meet those people in Istanbul . Vuladimir Zalinski , the president has made it very clear that he thinks he should meet only with Vladimir Putin at the presidential level and people I 've been speaking to in Kiev this morning absolutely agree with that . They think it would be demeaning to Ukraine for Vadimir Zalinski to meet with anyone at a lower level . Earlier , Mr. Zalinsk 's chief of staff , Andre Yeermach , said that the Ukrainian delegation would only meet with a lower level Russian delegation , not including Putin , if a ceasefire had already been announced . The expectation here now is that they will probably meet anyway , even if a ceasefire is not yet announced . But at what level , , we do n't know . One man I spoke to this morning said very clearly that they should match the Russians level for level and not allow them to get away with any playing trying to suggest that the Ukrainians are being forced into this meeting and sending people who are at a higher level than the Russian delegation . But who is in Turkey at the moment for Ukraine ? , the foreign minister Andre Siga certainly is there and he has met this morning with his French , German and British counterparts . He also met with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio . Vladimir Zilinski is also in Turkey but not in Estanbul and Cibiga is in Antalya of course because there 's the informal NATO foreign minister 's meeting there . Vad Zalinski is in Anchora , the capital . The talks with Russia are supposed to be taking place in Istanbul if they take place at all , the largest city in Turkey . Expectations in Ukraine are low , but what people are saying pretty consistently in terms of those I 've spoken to this morning is that they do n't really expect anything to come out of this , but they still hope that something might . Want to talk more ?"

The group warning that its inaction has enabled Israel 's ongoing military offensive . , Philip Taylor , international affairs editor , is still with me here on set . Philip , what 's the basis then for these accusations ? , , this is n't a story which was reported to the British state of the Guardian yesterday . It says that there is a group or witness a growing split between different groups within the European Union . this is a group of EU workers calling themselves EU staff for peace . Say the inaction of the European Union has contributed to the environment of unaccountability that resulted in the full - scale invasion of the Ga Strip taking place at this moment . they say that the EU has been far too slow to react to do to all of this . It is far too divided in its response to what is going on in the Ga Strip and in its condemnation of the attitude and the way that the Israeli prime minister has been handling this affair and that they want more action taken by the European Union . They want it for example to suspend the EUIsraeli agreement in member states arms exports to Israel . They also want it to pull out of a contract it signed with Israel over trade which has been signed back in 2000 . and it wants more action in banning the sale of weapons to Israel from the European Union . The problem here Stuart is that the EU is a 27 block number of nations and they do n't all see eye to eye . For example , you have Spain which is much more in favor of being hard towards the Israeli government and we 're just hearing from Sarah Morris . But you have other countries Germany , for example , which has just announced again that it 's going to continue its weapon sales to Israel because it says Israel has a to defend itself . And if weapon sales stop , that would open the door to Israel being victim for example to attacks from Iran or from Yemen , therefore it should carry on selling weapons to it . And also we had Ben Minetanyahu being welcomed in by Victor Orban , the prime minister of Hungary . So there is this big divide in the European Union . But what they 're saying is the EU Commission , the EU Parliament and other EU institutions should be much more united in their condemnation of what 's going on in Gaza . But for the moment , I 'm afraid that looks a bit a long shot . Philip , thanks very much for tell international affairs ."

One Palestinian has been shot and injured in Nabos . The Israeli army has deployed more tanks in several areas , including the cities of Tubas and Hebrron . Israel has stepped up its daily deadly raids in the occupied West Bank since the beginning of the war on Gaza . Killings of residents by armed settlers have also increased . , our correspondent Nid Abraham 's joining us live in the studio . A lot of the news agenda of course has been dominated by what 's been happening in Gaza , but we ca n't lose sight of whack of what 's been happening elsewhere . Just bring us up to date with what the latest . , the Israeli forces have been raiding different cities as you mentioned there , Habbron , Nabas , but also Bethlehem , which is a city adjacent to Ramla . So these are areas that are considered as part of area A among the OSA accords that were signed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority back in the 90s . As Palestinians would tell you that Israel takes no regard to this issue that the PA should be controlling area A , they raid the cities day in and day out . We must also not forget that the Israeli forces have been raiding Tul Karim Nam 's refugee camps , Janine refugee camp since mid January and these raids are ongoing where invasions are continuous . But not only that , house demolitions as well . And today we 're seeing a largecale raid that 's happening all across the occupied West Bank , injuring people . , people can be going to their schools , can be going to their work when they are suddenly surprised by Israeli military jeeps raiding them . Yesterday , for example , we 've seen Israeli forces raiding Nablas . But before that , they sent undercover units to the city . So they 're disguised in Palestinian clothing , Palestinian cars and then they catch people off guard before the raid starts and that could lead to also violent confrontations . Also we 've seen yesterday night a Palestinian man young boy was killed in Jericho in the occupied West Bank . That gives us again the nature of the violence that is happening in the occupied West Bank . But because of the scale of the relentless bombardment in Gaza , often eyes turn there . But what 's happening in the West Bank is not less serious . Ju just briefly N I want to ask you put us in give us some context about the fact that Israeli forces , if I understand it correctly , are targeting currency exchanges . Now I know this is something that has happened before , but it disappeared off the radar for a bit . Just talk to us briefly about that . , they often raid money transfer shops . We 've been covering it from there . Last year in Ramallah , we 've seen how when they were raiding one exchange shop , they set the whole vegetable market on fire . But today , what 's happening is that they 're raiding several money transfer shops across the occupied West Bank . And the Israeli army has released a statement saying that these money transfer shops are used for funding what they call terrorism . Of course , Palestinians would deny that . There 's no way they say that Israel can prove that this money is being given or funneled to Palestinian fighting groups amongst the occupied West Bank . But we should also remember that no matter how many fighting groups in the occupied West Bank there are , they are still very small groups , very limited and there has been a crackdown on them specifically in Janine and Tulkarim . The Palestinians would tell you this is a way that Israel reminds the community who has the upper hand and control over all aspects of their lives including money .

https://youtu.be/9QeuPnPpojI?si=FA-h8bhiM_MxktuE,Widely condemned US-Israeli-backed aid group starts operations in Gaza,Al Jazeera English,9QeuPnPpojI,"A controversial aid group backed by the US and Israel says it 's begun operations in Gaza despite objections from the United Nations . The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says it 's now opened its first distribution hubs in southern Gaza . On Sunday , its executive director resigned , saying the mission could n't adhere to humanitarian principles . The UN and other aid groups say the scheme would force further displacement of Palestinians and could breach international law . The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is a new organization meant to control the delivery of aid into Gaza after Israel blocked the United Nations from entering the strip . Now , it 's backed by the US and Israel who say it 's going to stop Hamas from stealing aid . That 's an allegation that Hamas denies . Armed security contractors will guard the trucks from the border to collection points . Palestinians are expected to collect aid from those centers in southern Gaza , but there 's no provision for those too sick or weakened by famine to walk long distances across the strip . The United Nations has rejected the organization , saying it would not engage with a plan that disrespects humanity , neutrality , independence , or impartiality . Tarabo Zuma is outside Ga central Gaza 's largest hospital in Derala . How hard is it going to be tak for people to get to those distribution points in the south ? [ Music ] , it 's it 's really very difficult process in order to get and to help people to get aid from the recently formed aid distri distribution hubs in southern Gaza . And we have seen that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has posted photos for a group of locals who have got eight parcels from one of these aid distribution centers in southern Gaza and in one of the areas that is under the Israeli control . The organization said that it has started distributing aid for local communities here under the protection of private American security contractors . But on the ground , many Palestinians are questioning their neutrality of the foundation , saying that and they point to its ties to government involved in the war on Gaza , raising wide massive concerns regarding the use of aid as a political tool and to use it to control the move the movement of Gaza 's population . Given the fact that only who will move southward will get aid , it means that a very large proportion of Gaza 's population will not be able to get such aid because of that location in the northern part of this trip . The long distance is one of the basic challenges here because people will be forced to travel for long distance under very dangerous security circumstances in order to get such parcels that will be enough for very few days and later on they need to retra again . So their safety is not completely guaranteed neither from the Israeli military nor from the security measures that will be completely carried out in during the process of distributing aid that includes biometric screening at aid checkpoints . The work of this foundation also is triggering mounting criticism from humanitarian organizations and from the leadership of this foundation itself as the key executive director of the foundation just resigned couple of days ago and his resignation reflects the foundation 's failure in fact Rob to uphold basic humanitarian principles and has also triggered a wave of accusation that the foundation operates without sufficient transparency by passers trusted UN aid channels and intr and imposing intrusive security measures as well for many families . They decided to not go there in order to get aid and they are completely trusting what UN and other agencies have been doing over the course of the past decades regarding the process of aid distribution process and mainly what we are talking about here on the ground is that people are quite concerned that they might be relocated in other areas and wo n't be able to return back to their houses or their temporary shelters . So many challenges have been really emerging and will just shape a stumbling block regarding the success of the operations that will be carried out by such foundation . Dar just as you 've been describing there that even if they get to the distribution points the process of getting the aid is going to be very difficult . At the same time one of the risks that people are going to face as they try to make their way to those points is of course the ongoing attacks by the Israeli military . just talk to us about the latest attacks that have been happening . , it has been another sleepless night here in Gaza . As as you can clearly hear the background , the sound of drones continue to be extremely overheard approximately most of the time in Gaza and the Israeli military is still categorically operating in Gaza in main two areas in the northern border towns and villages and in the city of Kunes . The Israeli military set sets a clear target to defeat Hamas completely in these areas . But civilians have been completely bearing the cost of the cost of this political and military decision because they have been found themselves in the move against queas in the western side of Gaza city and in Al - Mawas area alongside the coastal line . And these recent air strikes were concentrated on residential houses in aa neighborhood where civilians there are reporting on ongoing furious battles raging between Hamas fighters and the Israeli occupation forces and the Israeli military continues as well to pound many shelters for local families . The latest was in Alcarama neighborhood in the western end of the Gaza city . As far as we know , that one Palestinian was killed in the strike . And here in the south , we continue to hear a series of explosions every now and then as a result of the Israeli ongoing expansion for the ground operations and the deliberate demolition of residential houses . Apparently , Israel is trying to turn into a model to be to look Rafa as a very devastating landscape and later we might see a gradual transfer and expansion for these ground operations to involve and include further areas in which the Israeli military will not operate for . using apparently the main justification to defeat Hamas as a clear reason to destroy what 's left and what remains of Gaza 's residential and civilian infrastructures as well . Derek , thank you very much indeed . That 's Ti Kapo and they 're bringing us up to date from outside central Gaza 's largest hospital in Derabala .

This is Diane , too weak to cry . After days in Kunar 's hospital , he 's stronger , but millions still suffer . Afghanistan 's children face some of the world 's worst malnutrition rates . Even before the Taliban takeover , more than 40 % were stunted and almost 10 % of children suffered from acute malnutrition . Yet , aid has vanished , leaving families desperate . Chronic illness here is a death sentence , says Dian 's mother , who spoke anonymously . We can not afford to go to a private hospital . My husband works on daily wages in Kandahar and coast . His earnings are spent on medical expenses and household costs . My mother - in - law has tuberculosis as well and we spent almost everything on her treatment . After two decades of war and aid programs under a US - led occupation , Afghanistan 's children are still starving . A million could die without help . And it 's getting worse . Malnutrition in children is caused by insufficient food , chronic infections , and lack of medical care . Financial problems or poverty are the basic causes . We need a multis sectoral approach so that we can prevent it . In remote parts the Ferrroni village , as many as 26,000 people rely on this basic health unit . Hila 's mom says this clinic saved her daughter 's life as her husband does n't have a job . I brought my daughter here because she 's weak . We 're here to get her a card which will allow the hospital to provide her with readyto - use foods and medicines so she can gain some weight . Aid workers are calling the rates of malnutrition unprecedented and alarming . every aspect of life . Droughts , unemployment , the rising cost of living are all contributing to food insecurity . Billions of dollars of Afghan reserves are frozen and the loss of international aid has added to an economic collapse . For mothers and girls , it 's even worse . No school , no doctors , no way to fight malnutrition . The recent global funding cuts means that lives are at risk . The hundreds and thousands of children who need therapeutic feeding are not just numbers . They are lives . They are real lives that if that will be lost if we do not act now . Among these 1.5 million children are projected to suffer from the most life - threatening forms of acute malnutrition . We also have 1.2 million pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers who are also likely to experience acute malnutrition . The UN 's Children Agency says Afghan children ca n't wait and they need immediate humanitarian aid . But frozen funds and broken supply chains block real help . And aid groups say if the world fails to act , malnutrition will a generation and with it an entire nation 's future . This is n't just hunger . It 's a silent emergency .

Chinese products reach the world through this convenient logistics channels . Highquality international goods also come to China through here . Goods gathered here are distributed by rail , road , and via the Yangze River . About 20 trains depart here every day . Some head towards Russia . Others pass through Central Asia destined for Europe . Trucks carry goods to Vietnam , Thailand , and Myanmar . Some end up at shipping ports , reaching other Asian nations by sea . Beijing 's been expanding hubs this since trade tensions began with the US during President Donald Trump 's first term . Trade with the United States may be declining , but exports to Europe , the Middle East , and Asia are rising , making inland transit hubs this in Chongqing even more important . Around 50,000 types of goods valued at more than $ 400 billion , are shipped from Chongqing every year . Regional factories , which produce electronic hardware and cars , are major beneficiaries . Improved supply chains have helped many of these companies extend their global reach . Increase the trade with Athen Europe will help make China 's trade system more comprehensive and open .

https://youtu.be/ulBjvW6ZmxE?si=dxVGDupzXX_QzYyH,The explanations behind the confusion over a Gaza ceasefire deal,Al Jazeera English,ulBjvW6ZmxE,"Now , sources have told Alazer that Hamas has agreed to a US proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza . It 's understood that the group and the US special envoy , Steve Witkoff , have agreed to a draft deal at a meeting in Qatar 's capital , Doha . Sources tell us it includes a 60 - day ceasefire and the release of 10 living captives in two stages . The US president will guarantee the terms of the deal and the withdrawal of Israeli troops . Sources say it would guarantee unconditional humanitarian aid from day one . The American envoy is said to have sent the draft to the Israeli government and is currently waiting for a response . , let 's bring in Alazer senior political analyst Maran Bashara . He joins us now from Paris . Maran , amid all this speculation , tell us what you make of all this . Is there genuine progress happening here ? , there 's certainly certain confusion especially in light of the retractions that we hear from Washington and hence I think there 's probably one of three explanations or scenarios . Scenario number one is that the United States and Israel or Witkov and Netanyahu are playing good cup bad cup in the sense is that there is a division of labor and they 're trying merely to pressure Hamas by hook or crook as it were to make major concessions accept an exchange deal without ending the war or it could be that there 's real disagree agreement between Witkov and Netanyahu and Witkov has lost all faith in Netanyahu because Netanyahu does n't want to stop the war for his own personal and ideological reasons and that 's why Witov is creating a new contact directly with the hostage families in Israel . And the third and last I would say it 's somewhere in between meaning we are in a moment of flux whereby the good cup bad cup is giving away is giving way to a major differences between the United States and Israel whereby Trump has lost faith in Trump in Netanyahu and wants to pursue a deal he did earlier with releasing that one American Israeli I think the third is probably more likely in light of the international pressure that is building up . You speak about the international pressure . Despite all of that , Israel seems to have only ramped up its campaign in Gaza . Despite all of that international condemnation , what do you think the relationship is now between Netanyahu and the White House ? You 've said that there might be increasing pressure . Could that lead to some break ? , here we go again , ? there 's one of two possible explanations of why Israel is intensifying . One is because maybe it feels that time is running out and it 's turning on its most sadistic possible bombardment of burning , killing , bombing and so on so forth in Gaza so that when the time comes Nata would say look I did everything possible . I 've killed so many and I 've destroyed so much and so on so forth . or in fact he does n't give a damn about what the Europeans and others are saying because they are not walking their talk in a sense that they are expressing their criticism and their objection to the way the war is going . They do n't the pictures of famine of children dying and starving . But in the end of the day , what are exactly doing except certain symbolic steps ? And that 's why Netanyahu thinks he can still get away with doing what he does because Trump has not put a stop to it . , let me ask you then about some of the details that are ostensibly in this draft document because they 're also a little confusing . It reportedly includes this 60 - day ceasefire , but then also talk of an Israeli withdrawal . We 've been talking for months now about red lines . Hamas has always said that it would not accept a temporary ceasefire . So is there any movement then with the red lines ? , this is the thing , ? NATO is even adding new red lines to the to the original red lines and that 's why you are absolutely . There is confusion because of course one there is no direct negotiations and three the United States is negotiating on behalf of Israel and we hear all these retractions . , they agreed . , they did agreed . , I 'm disappointed and so on so forth . Again , my sense is that when it comes to that one explosive point , there is no agreement . Hamas insists that there is no point of all of this . It 's not a question of hostages . It 's not a question of prisoners . It 's not exchange . It 's a question of ending the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza . For Netanyahu , it 's exactly the opposite . he must continue with the war and he does n't want to withdraw from Gaza and his pretext is that his coalition will implode and there is absolutely no need for him to do that until and unless he is able to disarm Hamas and kick them and the rest of Gazans out of the strip . M this idea that there might be some US guarantee for the terms of any deal that is eventually agreed if at all . What do you make of that ? Is the US in a position to be able to make those kinds of guarantees ? That is such a good point . That is such a good point because we in the media and our viewers around the world must have a memory . We all must have memory . We ca n't just think of in terms of the day and the week and the month . Biden , the former president , gave such guarantees , unquote guarantees in the sense he said many times in public that the three - phase deals means that after phase one , Israel and the Palestinians will continue to negotiate without the war resuming . That 's what he guaranteed and that 's where they went into the security council with that resolution saying that the American president says that if they go in good faith in phase one , phase 2 , phase three , there 's going to be no problem . It 's going to be resolved . But guess what ? The American president was not able to walk his talk and Israel ended up after phase one saying , "" Look , we do n't give a damn . Biden is out . Trump is in . "" and the war continued even more or worse than it ever was . Will Trump be able to do what Biden could n't do ? Is there a will on the part of the Trump admination to do that ? And why ? None of that is clear for the time being . Mwan Bashara Alazer 's senior political analyst there speaking to us from Paris today .

Founded by Martha Stewart Haskell , a Canadian philanthropist in memory of her late husband , Carlos Freeman Haskell , a wealthy American sawmill owner from Vermont . Here we are in Canada . The building sits quite on the border , marked by black tape on the floor , and has welcomed visitors from both countries ever since . and her husband Carlos American . Sylvia Budro is Canadian and the president of the board of trustees and they decided to build this specially on the border because they wanted to promote literacy , arts and culture for both countries for both communities . The feet in Canada and the butt in the state . Long a symbol of the two countries interconnectedness , the library is now emblematic of their growing divide . The main entrance to the library is here . It 's in Vermont , but for more than 100 years , it 's been accessible to Canadians and Americans alike . Not anymore , however . Starting in October , Canadians will have to use a completely different entrance at the insistence of the US government . A new entrance is being built here under the watchful gaze of security cameras designed to deter crossber smuggling . The mayor of Stanstead , the Canadian town just to the north , acknowledges there have been minor security issues in the past . , if you look at the end of the street here , you 'll see that there 's a border patrol vehicle that sits there pretty much 24/7 . But he questions the approach . I think it makes it less secure . It 's two interestes that to take care of rather than one . Local residents on both sides of the border see it as an attempt to divide them . And now , , it 'll be different . I think it 'll change the vibe . I do n't think there 's a whole lot of u ruffians and terrorists streaming through the library . But it does n't seem to be working . We 're going to be more united .

And still , Alisanello from Guinea has not found wealth . A poor man from a rich land , his life appears a broken promise . Scrapping by in the Seneagalles capital , picking up debris on the construction site of a luxury apartment block to keep the tin shack back home standing and the family free from hunger . There are so many multinational companies in my homeland , but no work for us Guinians . It does not feel fair or . From Jello 's Tamille region to Bokeh in Guinea stretches a vast land of more than 41,000 km . Beneath the forest lies red earth rich in minerals . Trucks rumble down dirt roads carrying Guiney 's wealth off the continent to build planes , soda cans , even iPhones . luxuries most people here ca n't even dream of . So they leave crossing borders in search of work they can not find at home . Most of those working in this construction site are from neighboring Guinea . They make up the largest migrant population in Sagal . They 're not fleeing war or conflict , but the lack of opportunities at home . In 2020 , we met Keta . He says he still remembers the polite smiles of mining officials flanked by armed security who told him to leave . He was handed the equivalent of $ 2,000 for a piece of land the size of 200 football fields . Much of that land mining companies bought remains untouched . Companies have been sitting on assets , choosing speculation over investment in what feels an increasingly uncertain global market . And so Guiney 's military rulers under sanction and strapped for cash are taking action . In May , they revoked more than 50 mining licenses , targeting concessions where no real work had begun , and vast resources remained untapped . We reached out to several mining companies that lost their licenses . None were willing to comment on the Genta 's decision . Mining companies need to ensure that Gineian nationals and local companies have a greater stake in production and in subcontracting . So they 're staking the fact that if you are non - compliant , you would rather leave the sector and make way for other stakeholders who are likely to be compliant and continue investing in the region . The Juna calls it a cleanup part of a push to attract what it calls serious investors . For this nation , once supported by the Soviet Union , Russia and China now fit that profile .

https://youtu.be/Po3hBhwXoPM?si=1yRVeaVx2bm1XMhA,"US-Israel aid plan 'washes' Gaza genocide, says ex-UNRWA spokesperson",Al Jazeera English,Po3hBhwXoPM,"An aid group due to bring supplies into Gaza under a USIsraeli plan says it will begin distributing supplies on Monday despite its executive director resigning . Jake Wood has stepped down from the post with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation two months after being tasked to coordinate the delivery of aid in the strip . The plan to use private contractors and distribution sites designated by Israel has been criticized by the UN and aid groups . Wood says he sought to establish the organization as an independent humanitarian entity and added he feels proud of the work that he oversaw , including developing a plan that could feed hungry people . But he said it 's not possible to implement that scheme while also respecting the humanitarian principles of humanity , neutrality , impartiality , and independence , which he says he will not abandon . We 're joined now by Chris Gunners . He 's the former chief spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees . He joins us now from London . Many thanks for taking the time to speak to us , Chris , on Alazer English . you 've been very critical of the GF GHF and its new aid distribution model , describing it in your words as aidwashing . What do you mean by those comments ? , it 's quite simply the use of humanitarian aid to justify the weaponization of humanitarian assistance , but also to justify ethnic cleansing and genocide , which is exactly what we 're seeing . But can I say that thankfully now we 've seen the mercenary the man in charge of this mercenary outfit was outfit resign . We need to move on and talk about how we can stop the slaughter because no make no mistake the latest pictures that I 've seen of babies and young children coming out of Gaza , they look the emaciated survivors of Hitler 's and the Nazis death camps that were liberated in 1945 . So the question is , will the Europeans and the Americans who were so crucially involved in those tragic events in the Second World War now take effective action or will they carry on ringing their hands ? Will they stop the supply of arms in compliance with the International Court of Justice ? Will they stop trading with Israel in compliance with European and their own legislation on arms on trading commercial trading with Israel ? And what about the Americans ? What we 're seeing increasingly is Israeli generals and former generals quoting Lloyd Austin who talked about a tactical victory , sorry , a tactical victory but a strategic defeat . And I think with 50,000 people killed in Gaza , including tens of thousands of children , women , and babies , the time has come for America to say enough is enough . Having pictures of starving Arab babies on television screens across America is going to completely wreck Trump 's attempts to do the deal of the century with the Gulf . , Chris ? Going back to this aid distribution organization . , regardless of Jake Wood 's resignation , the head of the organization , the GFHF has announced that it plans to proceed with its aid distribution plan and it aims to reach over a million people in Gaza . How realistic do you think that is ? I think that what we 're going to see as we 've seen before with the weaponization of aid , the subcontracting of aid to mercenaries is the disaster we saw with a flower massacre in February last year when over 100 people were killed when inexperienced people brought in trucks , parked them next to an Israeli checkpoint . Over 700 people were injured when there was a food riot . You can not , the only organization , I say again , that is capable of delivering aid to scale in Gaza to stop these emaciated Holocaust surviving images on our screens of children in Gaza is for UNRA to step up . Only UNRA has the infrastructure , the warehouses for food , the food distribution centers , the trucks , the vehicles , the stuff , the long track record over decades of building up trust in the communities to deliver aid . And by the way , the Colona report , the independent report into Israel 's trumped up allegations against UNRA of involvement with the October attacks , that report was very clear that UNRA has neutrality frameworks and mechanisms , which are way better than any other UN aid agency . And by the way , those agencies have hundreds of staff max . UNRA has thousands . That 's what we need to scale up aid . And and just to be clear to our viewers , when you refer to mercenaries , you are talking about the fact that the GHF intends to use private contractors who will reportedly guard those distribution hubs where the Palestinians must gather to collect their aid supplies . what are the concerns about that ? Indeed . , as I said , and when people who do n't have long humanitarian experience , people who are frankly mercenous , backed incidentally by the Israeli -wing private sector and the Americans , do this . It ends in disaster and humiliation . Look at the so - called floating pier . $ 230 million worth washed away because aid distribution was left to the military , to mercenaries . It will end in further deaths . It will end in humiliation . It will not end with the starvation which we 're now seeing amongst the babies . We 've seen those terrifying images . It will not stop that deepening . What we need now is for the crossings to be opened up 24/7 and for ENRA , the backbone of an aid operation into Gaza needs to be immediately scaled up , which by the way it can do very , very quickly . It needs to be given the chance . Otherwise , we 're going to see deepening embarrassment for the Americans and for the Europeans . Just recently , the German chancellor said he 's going to say to Netanyahu , "" You can not use your war against your fight against Hamas as an excuse for inflicting this pain on civilians in Gaza . "" Let 's hope the Europeans and the Americans begin to realize we 've now crossed the point of no return . They can not continue openly to back genocide . It 's unspinable . It 's unjustifiable . The policy has to change . And if nothing does change even in the short term , given we appear now to have reached a point where this new aid distribution organization plans to take over from the UN . It looks it 's inevitable . Do you think the UN should be working with this organization ? Something it 's refused to do for the benefit of the Gazen people . I think that aid has to be distributed as this man who 's just resigned has said on the four humanitarian principles and the most important of those I would say apart from obviously all the neutrality provisions is on the basis of need and only UNRA has the ability to distribute aid at scale and on the basis of need if you do n't distribute aid according to the four humanitarian principles as Tom Fletcher the head of Otra New York has said as Philippe Lazari I has said he talked about a second Nakba that 's on the way and I think we have to listen to the human humanitarian leaders in UNRA at the level of the secretary general in New York . We have to listen to these people . The member states have to realize that this mercenary organization will not deliver aid according to those principles . We 're going to have further disaster and it has to be averted and it has to be averted now . Chris Gunnness . Many thanks for speaking to us in Alazer , English .

They set fire to Palestinian homes and assaulted residents . It 's the second attack on the village in three days . Settler violence in the occupied West Bank has increased since the war in Gaza began . , this comes as thousands of -wing Israelis are marching through occupied East Jerusalem , celebrating Israel 's occupation of the city in 1967 following the 6 - day war . They are making their way through Palestinian neighborhoods , chanting death to Arabs , as well as anti - Islamic slogans . Police forces were dispatched in advance as the settlers regularly assault and harass Palestinians in the Muslim quarter . They have also stormed the headquarters of the agency UNRA in the neighborhood of Shake Jar a little earlier today . Also earlier this Monday , more than 1500 farright Israelis forced their way into the Alexa Mosque compound . The national security minister Bengavia and other Israeli far- ministers were in that group . Jordan 's foreign ministry has strongly condemned the intrusion saying that it is a deliberate provocation . , we have in the studio with our correspondent Nida Ibrahim . Nida , you are normally covering this story from closer to where things are happening from occupied West Bank . You 're here in the studio . So it is it is a very important day in terms of how controversial it is for the Palestinians . Talk us through what we can expect today . , what 's already happening now , Malen , is that Israelis inside the old city of Jerusalem , attacking Palestinians , harassing them in the western part of the city , they are gathering to start their march . And let 's set the scene for our audience by showing this map and seeing how the protesters are going to move . They 're usually starting at the western part of Jerusalem where they make their way with their flags with chanting slogans towards the old city of Jerusalem but they do that through Damascus gate . Now this gate now we usually see it bustling with people with Palestinians . Now it 's almost empty because many shopkeepers have had to shut down their stores and leave because of the violent nature of the attacks . Now the march keeps going through the old city passing through the Muslim quarter and it ends at the Western Wall Judaism 's holiest sites and it is also in occupied East Jerusalem . What the Israelis want to show from this annual event that has been happening every year since 1968 is that Jerusalem is their capital and it 's not divided between the western side and the eastern side . Of course , the international community at large does not recognize Israel 's annexation of the eastern part of the city . It 's still considered occupied , but for the Trump administration in its first term , it has announced that it 's moving the embassy . It already did that and it recognized Jerusalem as the capital , but for the international world , it remains occupied . This is a day where Palestinians and occupied East Jerusalem are reminded that they are still suffering and lingering under occupation . They 're still telling the world that there would be no state without Jerusalem as their capital . So for Palestinians , this is a day that reminds them of occupation . For Israelis , it 's a day that they see as victory . As you said there , Maline , they talk about chanting slogans , anti - Arabs , anti - Muslims , anti - Palestinians . Already happening now as we speak . They 're dancing as you can see now . And if I can move in closer , this is the Damascus Gate . This is the heart of the old city in occupied East Jerusalem . And usually what happens here is that if they see any Palestinian , they would attack them . They would chant slogans . We 've seen them already spitting on Palestinians passing by . This event is not only funded by a settler organizations , but it receives funding from the Jerusalem municipality itself . So that gives you an idea about the sense of impunity . They feel there are around 3,000 police officers providing protection for these settlers as they storm through occupied East Jerusalem , harassing and intimidating Palestinians . N I also want to ask you about the ultra - Israeli nationalists that have stormed the headquarters of UNRO . I mentioned that just a little earlier . I was speaking to the former head of UNRO , Chris Gunnness . why is this organization so contentious for the Israelis ? , it 's a reminder of what the Israelis , as Palestinians would tell you , do not want the world to remember , which is that Palestinians have been forcibly kicked out and displaced from their homes in two occasions . in 1948 when the state of Israel was created and in 1967 which is the event that Israelis are celebrating now which has led hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to be displaced and owner what was established at the time to take care of the Palestinian refugees until a solution is reached . Of course , what happened over the years is not only they have been further and further away Palestinians from reaching that dream and that to return to their lands , but there also been steps to undermine UNRA . We 've seen a legislation by the Israeli to ban Onarua and its operations in Jerusalem . We 've seen staffers from the UN leaving the premise , the entity and now we 've seen Israelis storming on . It 's a reminder also to Palestinians that they have no protection that there are really no mechanisms left to take care of them and their issue . And as now in these scenes still settlers are dancing , celebrating while Palestinians in the very same city are still suffering . They Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem do not have a citizenship . They have what Israel calls a permanent residency meaning that Israel can provoke them from that , can pull that residency any time it deems appropriate . And this is seen by Palestinians as a way to ensure that more Israelis live in occupied East Jerusalem than Palestinians are . They feel that the efforts to push them out of their homes are still continuous . Thank you so much for your reporting Nid Abraham there for us .

https://youtu.be/Ulm-qISArlA?si=DAqycCTOtd4LRDoZ,Israeli settlers storm Al-Aqsa Mosque compound to celebrate ‘Jerusalem Day’,Al Jazeera English,Ulm-qISArlA,"Nearly 1,500 ultraist Israelis have entered the Alexa Mos compound in occupied East Jerusalem . They were protected by Israeli forces . It comes ahead of the Jerusalem Day march when -wing Israelis celebrate Israel 's occupation on the city in 1967 . Let 's bring in our correspondent Nita Ibrahim . She joins us here live in the studio . Now Nita , this is an annual event . What do we expect to happen in the coming hours ? , we expect a lot of tension and provocations specifically against the Palestinians inside occupied East Jerusalem . What usually happens is that tens of thousands of -wing Israelis marching from the western part of Jerusalem going through the old city of Jerusalem that is considered part of the occupied East Jerusalem part . Now , let 's remember that while Israel has occupied and annexed the city after the six- day war in 1967 , the international community at large does not recognize that annexation . But we have seen the Trump presidency and when it in 2017 and 2018 recognizing Jerusalem as Israel 's capital , moving the US embassy to Jerusalem , but at large Palestinians would tell you that there 's no state without Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital . And you have Israelis on the other hand who are celebrating and saying this is the day that they consider that Jerusalem has become undivided their undivided capital . But again the international community sees this as an issue that should be negotiated and should be part of the final status negotiations . Now what really triggers tension in the city is that these protesters under the protection of around 3,000 Israeli officers chant anti - Arab , anti - Islamic , anti - Palestinian slogans . It 's seen as one way that Israel is cementing its control over the city . So this is hugely provocative for Palestinians , especially those living in occupied East Jerusalem . We do expect tensions as they break out every year . What protections exist then for the Palestinians ? , Palestinians feel that they 've been left alone specifically in occupied East Jerusalem by the rest of the world . Remember , we are talking about Palestinians who only have permanent residencies inside the city . So , they are treated by Israel as guests in their own lands . And even sometimes when Palestinian Jerusalem leave Jerusalem , the Israeli authorities could subject them to taking their IDs and taking the of their residency in the city . We are also talking about shops inside the old city of Jerusalem that have been already strangled . Remember , there 's not a lot of tourism going in and there 's also a lot of high taxes that are facing these store owners . And at the end of the day today , they have to close down their shops because of this provocative and march that will cross into occupied East Jerusalem . Really adding more and more to their suffering inside the city . So that 's an event we 'll certainly have to keep an eye on in the coming hours . Needed for the moment . Many thanks indeed .

https://youtu.be/AGE5KA1_fm0?si=mK3k0dzVFSSWwY1Z,Situation in Gaza is desperate with malnutrition cases on the rise: Save the Children director,Al Jazeera English,AGE5KA1_fm0,"[ Music ] A USIsraeli plan to bring aid into Gaza has suffered a setback . The executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has resigned . Jake Wood 's resignation comes just two months after he was tasked to coordinate aid distribution in Gaza . Wood said he sought to establish the organization as an independent humanitarian entity . He adds that he 's proud of the work he oversaw , including developing a plan that could feed hungry people . But he admits that it 's not possible to implement the plan whilst also respecting the humanitarian principles of humanity , neutrality , impartiality , and independence , which he says he will not abandon . What is the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation ? , it 's a new organization that 's meant to control the delivery of aid into Gaza after the Israelis block the United Nations from entering the strip . It 's backed by the US and Israel , who say it will stop Hamas from stealing aid . Hamas denies it steals aid . Armed American security contractors will distribute aid from collection points in southern Gaza , but there 's no provision for those who are too sick or weakened by famine to walk the long distances across the strip . The United Nations has rejected the organization , saying it would not engage with a plan that disrespects humanity , neutrality , independence or impartiality . Rachel Cummings is a humanitarian director at Save the Children and she joins us from Daravala in central Gaza . Thanks very much for coming onto the program , Rachel . We 'll talk a little bit more about the actual situation in Gaza in just a moment . First of all , I just want to get your reaction there . the feelings of the aid community towards this organization , the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation , being put in charge of delivering aid to Gaza . The humanitarian community in Gaza made up of the UN , international NOS 's and of course Palestinian NOS 's is very clear and united in our position in terms of not engaging within this aid system that is not based on our humanitarian principles . That is clear and what needs to be understood the complexity of the environment that we have all been operating in for many months and being able to deliver services and humanitarian assistance including food , water , shelter items . We know how to do our jobs . , we need to be allowed to deliver services and supplies to populations in need across Gaza . Rachel , we 've been seeing far too many images of starving children on our screens . You must see even more than us . Describe to us the situation there in Gaza at the moment . The situation here is desperate . It 's dire . And to be a child in Gaza is absolutely unimaginable . , over 11 weeks of no food , no supplies entering Gaza . And of course that will have an impact on children 's health and mental health status . we are seeing increased numbers of children with malnutrition very concerningly an increase in pregnant women and breastfeeding women and increase in their malnutrition status as well . So the situation is desperate . I see children every day walking the streets trying to find food with empty bowls , trying to find water with their empty bottles . , it 's really desperate . , we have mothers telling us how they 're trying to keep their children alive , how they 're trying to bulk out the food , whatever food they have , bulk it out with grass , with dirty water , knowing that could result in their child becoming sick . The situation is absolutely desperate . We 're hearing of around 100 trucks being brought in with very little aid carried in . just give us an idea of how significant that is for the 2.3 million people in Gaza , but also what else needs to happen . The aid that 's arrived in the last 72 hours with the UN and WFP and other UN partners . it is significant of course that aid has come into Gaza and we welcome any aid that comes into Gaza but it 's insignificant in terms of the impact it will have on individuals in Gaza . Very few people will be able to benefit from that . Unfortunately what is needed is the supplies that are in their thousands of trucks outside of Gaza being released and able to enter Gaza . And that includes food , food for kitchens , it includes water and sanitation items . And also , of course , it includes medicines for hospitals and for the clinics that say the children are running and the partners . That 's what needs to happen now . But of course , this is an very active and complex war . Bombs are dropping on children every day . So , we need a definitive ceasefire in Gaza . We need to be able to access populations and children who are in the most desperate of circumstances . And we need the humanitarian supplies to enter Gaza . And can those humanitarian supplies , those thousands of trucks you say are needed , can they be brought in via this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation organization ? , we know very little about the mechanics of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation . And as I said before , we 've been running the humanitarian operations and delivery of services and supplies since the beginning of the war over 18 months . So we know how to do this . It is very complex , but we are able to do this and we 've demonstrated that over time . , Rachel Cummings , it 's been fantastic to get you on to explain a little bit more about the actual situation there on the ground in Gaza .

https://youtu.be/X2NjApfqK2A?si=LZL_IY_gVHDD-q2e,Executive director of US-Israeli backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation resigns after two months,Al Jazeera English,X2NjApfqK2A,"Palestinians desperate for humanitarian aid have swamped one of the first trucks delivering supplies to northern Gaza in months . After more than 80 days of a total blockade , Israel has started allowing a limited amount of supplies into some parts of the strip . The Israeli army says it 's allowed more than 100 trucks carrying flour , food , and medicine . NOS 's and other groups say at least 500 trucks are needed every day to make a tangible difference . And there 's been a blow to a US - Israeli plan to bring aid into Gaza . The executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation , tasked with leading new aid distribution efforts , has resigned with immediate effect . Jake Woods 's resignation comes just two months after he was asked to lead the organization . He says he sought to establish it as an independent humanitarian entity . Wood says he 's proud of the work he oversaw , including developing a plan that could feed hungry people . He admits that it 's not possible to implement that plan while also adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity , neutrality , impartiality , and independence , which he says he will not abandon . Let 's bring in Robert Patman . He 's a professor of international relations at the University of Otargo . He joins us live from Duneden in New Zealand . , good to have you with us , , Robert . So , Jake Wood sounded rather diplomatic . Good morning to you . Jakewood sounded rather diplomatic in his resignation letter , saying he would never abandon his principles of humanity , impartiality , and independence . But reading between the lines , Robert , what do you think ? Why do you think he resigned ? I think he cumulatively realized and remember Jake Wood has a background in humanitarian assistance but dealing with natural disasters and I think he cumulatively realized that he was n't getting support from the organizations that he needed in order to make this USIsraeli initiative an effective independent humanitarian organization . It 's no secret the major aid donors had not been convinced by this proposal which is essentially a startup and secondly the UN and particularly ENRA have been very cool in response and have not have indicated they wo n't cooperate and I think the other thing here we have to take into account is that as it 's been pointed out many times there 's not a need for a new humanitarian organization per se in the eyes of the UN and aid organizations what 's needed is to end the blockade of food . . And so from their point of view or aid organizations see this as a confused thinking . And it is interesting Robert because the GHF has been criticized from the start , has n't it ? As it seemed to be overseen by the US and Israel . How much of a body blow is this to the US and Israel 's bid to distribute aid in Gaza at a minimum ? It 's highly embarrassing , is n't it ? It is a potential body blow . I understand Darren then started they started to intend they started they I say that again they intended to start the distribution of humanitarian aid in late May and that does n't look particularly practical at the moment and the crucial thing here is I think this initiative lacks international legitimacy in the eyes of some of the key stakeholders and that what is also striking and has caused problems is that Jake 's Jake Wood 's resignation . he said that he did n't believe the organization was adhering to humanitarian principles which he would not turn his back on which confirms the view the Swiss at the moment the Swiss government is exploring a legal complaint about the status of the US Israeli initiative . There is a perception internationally this is an attempt to weaponize the distribution of humanitarian aid rather than simply distribute aid to those who need it . . And even worse Robert there was to be no Palestinian involvement and the UN as you say was to be sidelined . Many critics say the smack of the US and Israel using the GHF to meet their own political objectives at the expense of people in Gaza who have been bombed and starved to death . . And I think that suspicion has been fueled by the fact that the Israel government makes no secret of the fact that it wants control of Gaza . And the Trump administration has already floated a proposal in the past which involved the displacement of the Palestinian population from Gaza . So in the eyes of much of the international community , the two parties who 've contributed to the current situation now wish to take over the operation of humanitarian aid when they have particular political goals in mind and that does fuel suspicion and concern that this would n't be a disinterested impartial humanitarian oper operation . Also , as I said before , it 's it 's not the best time to have a startup when you have tried and trusted organizations which simply are not being given the tools to do the job .

The uncertainty is very high . , we are still not very certain of whether this tariff will stay on or it 's going to be lifted . As you can see , Donald Trump , every week there 's news coming up . . So , this is where it 's going to be a big challenge for the entire supply chain . Previous summits have been marred by tensions about China 's expanding influence , especially in the South China Sea . But Azan members now seem to favor collaboration in the face of their shared tariff burden . I would say that to the Chinese they may be want to look into other markets and this would give us an opportunity as well to work with the Chinese manufacturers to explore other untapped markets by the Chinese and I 'm I 'm talking about the Middle East . I 'm talking about Turkey . As Azan now looks to deepen ties with its biggest trading partner , China . So , it 's also looking to strengthen links with other blocks in Europe , the Middle East , and other parts of Asia , which are also trying to navigate the turbulence created by the Trump administration . The number and seniority of delegations from those locations seems to indicate a heightened interest in forging closer ties with Southeast Asia . The importance and the strategic relevance of ASEAN have increased tremendously over the last 3 months . ASEAN has what is known as the convenor power as and when ASEAN would to unleash and solicit all the major powers to come to this part of the world . This summit coinciding with an upending of the system of global trade that could see Azan emerging with a greater international reach . Rob McBride , Alazera , Koala Lumpa .

Now the number of countries attending is increasing . Ministers of foreign affairs from the EU and the Middle East joining an expanding coalition to put pressure on Israel to end the war in Gaza . In this terrible moment , in this humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza , we aim at two things . first to stop this war from Israel in Gaza and to break the blockade of humanitarian assistant that must go in unimpeded and secondly because we want to create momentum towards June 17th that conference in UN in order for everyone that has still not done it to recognize the state of Palestine . Last year Slovenia , Norway , Ireland and Spain recognized Palestine . More recognitions are expected in the upcoming months . We need the recognition of Palestine . We need this war to end . We need the respect of international law , the respect of humanitarian law , and stop killing innocent civilians . What we are facing in Gaza is horrific . The EU has warned it may suspend its trade deal with Israel if it fails to allow aid into Gaza and end the war . But Egypt 's foreign minister says there 's no end inside . Fortunately , there is a lack of political will from the Israeli side . This is the main problem and we are but we will keep trying . We will apply maximum pressure . We will continue to exert our maximum efforts in order to push for a ceasefire . The gathering is also discussing ways to support the Palestinian Authority and finance the eventual reconstruction of Gaza . We hope that the Israeli government would listen to our demands for bringing in food , stop famine , stop genocide . many countries around the world see what 's happening and they clearly disapprove it . Spain is pushing for a tougher approach . Many countries are discussing possible sanctions and arm sales restrictions if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects growing calls for an end to the suffering of civilians in Gaza . For now , the EU , the UK , and their allies in the Middle East want to see an immediate end to the war in Gaza .

Hundreds of drones and missiles were launched across the country with a particular focus on the capital Kev . The strikes come days after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed Moscow has no interest in ceasefire negotiations . Talks Ukrainians are increasingly losing hope for . We do n't need talks , but weapons . a lot of weapons to stop them because Russia only understands a force . The more we talk about negotiations , the more we are being attacked . At least three children were killed in one of the strikes . Attacks also targeted Sunumi in the east and Mikolive in the south . President Vladimir Zalinski has accused Western allies of emboldening Russia . In a statement , he says Russia is dragging out the war and continues to kill every day . This can not be ignored . Silence of America , silence of others around the world only encourages Putin . While Russia 's defense ministry says it shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight on Sunday , forces are also claiming to have taken control of another village in the eastern Donetsk region . The attacks come despite the largest prisoner swap of the war taking place . Kev and Moscow have confirmed the release of 303 detainees each . A total of 2,000 prisoners have now been exchanged in the past 3 days . We hope the large - scale prisoner exchange carried out on Russia 's initiative will contribute to creating a favorable atmosphere for discussing the terms of a peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian crisis . The prisoner exchange remains the only concrete result of the first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in 3 years that took place in Estambul earlier this month .

Hani Mahmood spoke to some of them . We 're very shocking to see this tragedy keeps evolving for hundreds of displaced families fleeing from death and destruction , the unpredictable falling bombs . But soon enough , this area , Gaza Seapport , is running out of space . And soon enough , these waves here are not going to crash against the boats and the picnic tables , but against those tents that are set up very close to the water . We have been forced to leave our homes to escape death and destruction . This is supposed to be a safe zone , but there is not a single inch safe area in the entire Gaza Strip . Israeli forces issue warnings for residents to move to the west . Then they start bombing the west . Then they warn us to head south and then they start shelling the south . We do not know where to go . As we walk between tents , the waves of tents and the areas here , what caught our attention is the fact that people are setting up their makeshift tents . Already they set them up without any of the basic necessities available for them to support them to survive these difficult conditions . There 's no running water , no sanitation . Just to open the sky , the ground and the sea . Apart from the salty water of the sea , there is n't any safe access to drinking water for them . This is not a place for humans to live . It 's almost a landfill . Even animals would not stay in a place this . It 's in ruins . Besides , all residents are dumping their waste in the sea . The water has been contaminated and we started contracting skin disease , let alone the starvation and endless ruthless Israeli bombardment . I 'm leaving the Gaza Seapport now , but I 'm leaving it now with an overwhelmed sense of depressing feeling . This place , Gaza Seapport , used to be a connection to the world , to the sea , to life beyond the blockade . But now it 's a symbols of how far that world feels . It 's a place of memories buried underneath the urgency of survival . Hani Mahm Al Jazzer from Gaza City , Palestine . Make sure to subscribe our channel to get the latest news from Al Jazer ."
https://youtu.be/MWQQhED2xuY?si=R8AJ_XQJMZG9wZy2,How commercial drones turn deadly in Gaza,Al Jazeera English,MWQQhED2xuY,"The sound of drones is everywhere in Gaza . But in 2024 , against the backdrop of war , a trend started to appear . Drones made by the Chinese company DJI , built for commercial use , were being repurposed and used as tools to facilitate warfare . Ordinarily , farmers use DJI technology to spray their crops . Filmmakers use the drones to get that perfect shot . But Al Jazzer 's digital investigation team , SANAD , has uncovered how different models of DJI drones have been repurposed for military use in the Gaza Strip . For example , the small DJI Mini4 Pro has been used by the Israeli military for surveillance . The DJI Avatar , made for aerial filming , has been instead used to explore tunnels under Gaza . Larger drones the Matrice 300 RTK , commonly used for inspecting infrastructure , have been repurposed for military surveillance . But it 's the Agrass line of drones that had the most comprehensive transformation . Built to spray pesticides , SANAD says an Aggress drone was used by the Israeli military to drop explosives on civilian areas . This image verified by SANAD shows Israeli soldiers equipping an Agress drone with explosives . Humanitarian groups and residents in northern Gaza say they began noticing modified DJI Agress drones in late 2024 to early 2025 . In one incident , footage verified by Sanad captured a DJI Agress drone bombing an NGO 's building in Jabalia , just 100 m from a school being used as a shelter . In Bait Laia in November 2024 , an Agress drone can be seen dropping bombs on residential buildings . A bird 's eyee view of the site shows how close the target was to a school sheltering displaced Palestinians . Residents told Sanad that they were once again forced to flee because of the drone strike . Another incident involved a drone attack near Kamal Adwan Hospital on December 26 , 2024 . A geoloccation analysis shows the drone struck within 60 m of a hospital . These modified DJI drones were also used for tactical operations in this video posted on an Israeli soldier 's Tik Tok account . DJI drones are also being used for surveillance in this exclusive footage obtained by Al Jazzer . A drone can be seen following a Palestinian man believed to be a detainee as Israeli soldiers force him to enter a school and open doors as they sweep the area . When the Russia Ukraine war broke out in 2022 , DJI suspended sales of its drones to both countries . But DJI continues to sell to Israel during its war on Gaza and has not added so - called flight blocks in the strip , a safety feature that uses GPS to restrict drone flights over certain areas . When asked , DJI told Sanad in an email that its drones are for peaceful use and that Israel does n't have access to its special government use program . The program allows certain entities to bypass flight restrictions . SANAD also contacted the Israeli military for comment , but received no reply . Israel 's war on Gaza has shown how everyday technology can be turned into a weapon . And as drones become ever more accessible and capable , the line between their civilian use and their use in warfare is becoming increasingly blurred ."

The only connection is an unpaved dirt road which ends near the village . From there , people climb down into the fields . As there is no bridge , they must jump over rocks to reach their homes . The Serene village in eastern Nangahar province became famous when the US military dropped its most lethal non - uclear bomb here 8 years ago . The mother of all bombs or MOAB is the largest non - uclear bomb to have ever been used by American forces . And the 10 m long explosive is designed to cause a massive blast wave . Rather than exploding on impact , it detonates above ground . Experts say the nearly 10,000 kg bomb kills anyone within 300 m , and the shock wave can deafen people within a kilometer radius . Mulvin and others here say they 'd never heard a blast that loud before . And relatives saw the fireball from Lman and Kunar provinces . It was a great injustice to our people . They destroyed our homes . Homes made of mud which were more valuable to us than bungalows . So many houses were destroyed here . The new ones are built by people often by selling their livestock or women 's jewelry . Personally , I can not afford to even build a single room . There were no dishes fighters here . The ones who were here had already been killed . Everyone here wants to rebuild , but only a few can afford to restart their lives . All of the structures , every household was leveled in this village when the mother of all bombs was dropped here . People have started to rebuild their lives , but they still contest the accounts that were given by the then government and US officials . They say dozens of ISIL fighters had been killed earlier and the Afghan military evacuated residents before the Americans dropped the bomb . They accused the US government of using their village as a testing route for the weapon and they say it is still causing diseases . The blast caused many skin diseases , mental health issues , and respiratory illnesses . All of these problems are a direct result of the explosion . The new administration under the Taliban has n't been able to improve much here apart from security . People live off agriculture and farmlands have been severely affected by the bomb . And as they work harder to get the same yield they used to have , years after the US occupation ended , the villagers of this impoverished district are still waiting for answers .

He 's a former presidential candidate and is now running for a seat in the National Assembly . The opposition is divided and while opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is calling for a boycott of the elections , Capriles told Alazer it is a mistake because voting is an act of resistance against the government . History is full of evidence how voting is an instrument towards democracy . I believe the way we stood for our rights last year kept alive the peaceful fight for our constitution . Because voting is what we have left to manifest our rejection of Maduro and his government . On Sunday , Venezuelans head to the polls to elect governors and members of the National Assembly . But since the presidential elections last year , when the government failed to show the results to prove President Nicolola Maduro 's victory , many people have lost faith in the electoral process . I am not going to vote after they stole the elections last year . For what ? I do n't want to be disappointed again . But on the ruling party 's campaign trail , the mood is completely different . Even though the turnout is expected to be very low for the Venezuelan government , the election is a possibility of a complete sweep of power . Nicolola Maduro accused the opposition of attempts to destabilize the country ahead of the vote on Sunday . The death throws of fascism have tried to bring in mercenaries and today we have already captured more than 50 mercenaries who came in to plant bombs or launch violent attacks in the country . Political analysts say the chances that free and fair elections will take place are practically non - existent . There wo n't be witnesses at the table . Very few witnesses . Nobody wants to be a witness . Low voter turnout , ignorance about who the candidates are , and there are no international observers .

In a country overwhelmed by drugfueled violence , security was tight in Kito as the newly reelected president pledged to bring Ecuador back from the brink . What we 're going to do is return power to the Ecuadorian people who for a long time have felt abandoned . We will bring progress back to this country which has been and continues to be attacked by the mafias through both violence and violent politics . At the start of the year , once peaceful Ecuador averaged one killing every hour as cartels battle for control of cocaine routes . Organized crime has seeped into nearly every institution . Since taking office in a snap election , the young hair to a banana fortune has imposed a hardline strategy , deploying troops to the streets and designating criminal groups as terrorist organizations . But critics say these measures have shown limited results and come at the cost of constitutional rights . It 's clear the policies implemented have n't delivered results , but we also have to consider the nature of the crime has changed since the government declared an internal armed conflict , effectively a war . My sense is that NOBO will stick to the same approach and we can only hope it works . Noa plans to reopen a US military base and is requesting foreign military help . He 's also promising to tackle high unemployment and avoid a return of the blackouts that hit Ecuador in 2024 . With the economy shrinking 2 % last year , the worst in South America , he 's under pressure to show results quickly . Let 's pray to God that Daniel Noboa turns out to be a good president because the people chose him . And if he misbehaves , the same people will remove him . But for now , Ecuadorians have given their youngest ever president a vote of confidence . His toughen crime approach may the finest presidency , but whether it delivers peace and prosperity remains to be seen . Alexander , Al Jazzer .

Those sanctions have isolated Syria for decades . And now after lifting the sanctions , the country can be reintegrated again into the international community . Syria can now resume its oil exports , which can bring the government billions of dollars in oil revenues to help rebuild the war torn Syria . And also Syria can now be reconnected to the international financial swift system . The government has reacted with optimism about bringing investment , foreign investment into Syria in the fields of agriculture , , industry , trade , healthcare , and education . While people have received this decision with hope and anticipation , generally power outages in the economy are our major concern . We hope that these will improve so that commerce can get moving . We have n't experienced oil revenues before . That has always been for the elite . Now whether that will be for the people or not , that remains to be seen . We are happy with the lifting of the sanctions , but it remains to be seen whether there will be substantial change in our livelihoods . Since the first announcement of lifting the sanctions by US President Donald Trump during his tour in the Middle East in midmay , the Syrian local currency has started strengthening after years of drastic decline . And now this can be a step forward towards improving the US relationships not only politically but economically as well . Now , US companies can compete for the $ 400 billion construction project in Syria . All these sanctions started since 1979 , then 2004 , 2020 and 2011 were triggered by the human rights violations and actions of the deposed Assad regimes inside Syria , including the brutal crackdown on protesters and human rights violations and also its destabilizing rule in the region .

Elections for local councils are being held in the south of the country . Results in previous rounds so far indicate Hezbollah 's popularity within its constituency . The Muslim Shia community has not been affected by last year 's war with Israel . We want to show them we are here . We are the owners of the land . They tried to weaken us , but they did not succeed . It was Shia majority areas that Israel targeted and destroyed . Hezbollah 's leadership was killed , so were thousands of its fighters , and Israel continues to target the group despite a ceasefire , but Hezbollah has called for a high voter turnout . Hezbollah may have lost some of its hold in this region , but the turnout is an indication that it still commands loyalty . There 's a feeling among its supporters that attempts by Lebanon 's new leadership to disarm the group are part of efforts to marginalize the community as a whole . The post - war political landscape is not in Hezbollah 's favor , and the opposition feels it has an opportunity to break what many call the monopoly over power . A lot has changed since the last election . In the past , candidates of Hezbollah and his allies were running uncontested . They had the resources and the power . Even in this round of voting , Hezbollah 's candidates are running uncontested in many areas . But those pushing for a non sectarian alternative in a country where religious and political affiliations drive electoral choices believe change will come . There is no solid opposition to we . We are working on building that with our members , our friends , our allies . The idea is to be able to build for the next 12 months so that in the 2026 parliamentary elections , we 're able to do a much better score .

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says that the waiver will enable the supply of electricity , energy , water , even sanitation . Let 's speak now to Mahmud Abdul Wahed who 's live for us in Damascus . Mahmood , so what has the reaction been in Syria to the lifting of these sanctions and give us a sense of the impact that the lifting of these sanctions will have on the day - to - day life of ordinary Syrians ? , Maline , first of all , these sanctions were imposed in on Syria in several phases started in 1979 . and they 're all triggered by the actions and rule , destabilizing rule of the assets regime in Syria and in the region . 1979 , this was the first time the US sanctioned Syria . and when it labeled Syria as a state sponsoring terrorism in 2004 for Syria 's rule in the unrest in Lebanon and 2011 during the brutal crackdown by the Syrian regime on protesters and the human suffering caused by also by human rights abuses by the Assad regime against civilians against protesters . The latest one was in 2020 under what is so - called the civilian protection act known as the Caesar act and that triggered or that targeted the foreign companies doing businesses with the Syrian government under the asset rule . The impact of lifting those sanctions now has a huge benefit on Syrians and on the new leadership . First of all , the Syrian government can now resume the oil exports and can gain huge revenues to help recon reconstruct their war torn countries . It also it will also reconnect Syria to the international financial swift code and also can fix all the destroyed sectors including health care system the education the investment can attract more investment foreign investment to the country and this way the US companies can compete with Chinese firms about or for the about $ 400 billion contract for reconstructing Syria .

Explosions were heard throughout the night in Kev . At least 15 people have been injured and several buildings damaged . Ukraine 's president Zalinski says it shows that Moscow is dragging out the war . Meanwhile , Russia and Ukraine are expected to exchange a second group of prisoners later on Saturday . On Friday , the two sides handed about 390 prisoners of war from each side , including 120 civilians . It 's the largest exchange of the three - year war so far . Last week , both sides agreed to swap a thousand prisoners each during talks in Istanbul . , let 's go to John Hendren . He 's live for us in the Ukrainian capital , Kee . John , before we get into the prisoner exchange , can you talk us through firstly the latest attacks that we 've seen in Kev ? , many of us here in the city center awoke between 4 and 5 a.m. to the sounds of booms . Those were missiles and drone explosions and anti - aircraft fire , the answering fire from Ukraine . And this happened in an unusually large attack . the mayor of Kev says it is a massive enemy attack on the capital . 15 people were injured . Those attacks left apartment blocks and other buildings flaming and around the region and elsewhere . 128 of the 250 drones were shot down according to Ukrainian officials . And they also say they shot down six out of 14 missiles . But this is an acceleration of the attacks on the capital as Russian forces also seek to move incrementally forward on the eastern front . There were several people killed in the Donetsk region and to the south in Odessa . So on the Russian side , they 're definitely stepping up their attacks . But the Ukrainians have also been stepping up their attacks on Russia itself launching a number of drone attacks in recent days that have shut down air travel . So both sides as they talk about possibly a ceasefire coming up and a peace negotiation seem to be trying to solidify their gains in advance of that . And on a more positive note , we have the largest prisoner exchange of the war so far . significant moment for both sides . That 's . This is day two of what we believe will be three days of prisoner exchanges with a total of 1,000 prisoners on each side . On Friday , we saw 270 troops and 120 civilians return here to Ukraine and the same number returning to Russia . Andir Zalinsky , the president of Ukraine , says that will continue here on Saturday and on Sunday . And that was the one thing that Zalinski says came out of the talks in Turkey a week ago . He said essentially nothing was accomplished there . He had hoped for that to be a meeting between himself and Vladimir Putin of Russia , but instead it was lower level officials and they essentially agreed on nothing except this prisoner exchange . And that 's a big step because they will be celebrated here in Ukraine for example as symbols of resiliency returned heroes in the Ukrainians eyes . so that is the one big accomplishment for both sides out of that Turkish agreement .

Rwanda 's government and M23 's leaders say they 're committed to conservation . UN investigators say M23 's fighters collect about $ 2 million a year from charcoal traders at checkpoints . M23 's fighters are accused of widespread rights abuses . Commanders deny it .

That 's thanks to the Philippine government 's new subsidized rice program . It 's really helpful , especially because we are a big family . We cook 1 kilo of rice every meal . We can use the savings to buy more food . Despite prices declining in major rice exporting countries in the last 6 months , people in some Asian nations are still struggling to afford the staple food . Public discontent over the Japanese government 's inability to lower costs boiled over after agriculture minister Takuto said he gets his supply of rice for free , forcing his resignation . In the Philippines , lowering tariffs on imported rice had little effect . Now , officials say a government program to sell stock piles at a loss will help drive down market prices . The government plans to expand its subsidized rice program to more areas , but only senior citizens , solo parents , the disabled , and claimants of state benefits will be able to benefit . Most consumers will have to buy rice that 's twice the subsidized price . But the Department of Agriculture says that 's just for an initial roll out . Our target by September where we can reach up to 3.3 million households or 14 million Filipinos . A target critics say is unsustainable . Leonardo Monteor is a former agriculture secretary . He says the government has to pay at least double what a kilo of subsidized rice costs the consumer . , it has the money if it wants to continue increasing its deficits , but for how long can it sustain the that level of expenditure and not impact later on our interest rates and so on . But the government says its subsidy is a good investment . those that might be minuscule , , , in comparison to the , , socioeconomic benefits . Farmers are n't so sure . They say lower prices could further squeeze already small profits . But for millions of other Filipinos , cheaper rice is a promise President Ferdinand Marcus Jr. made in his 2022 campaign that is finally fulfilled . Barnabo Alazera , Manila .

https://youtu.be/fMMqUFHcHm8?si=h3qsyk1qSFyaTWQ7,Chile's peace proposal: President aims to end conflicts with Mapuche people,Al Jazeera English,fMMqUFHcHm8,"Members of an indigenous Mapuche Confederation listen carefully as President Gabrielle Borich delivers an address to the nation detailing a new multipartisan plan to bring about peace in rest of South Central Chile . The area which has been under a state of emergency for years is home to thousands of Mapuches who are claiming ancestral lands . Radical groups have been carrying out attacks and destroying property in a deadly vicious circle of violence . In the BBO , Arania , Los Rios , and Los Lagos regions , a very long and painful conflict between the Chilean state and the Mupuche people have been taking place , impacting millions with violence and underdevelopment . Bod said a new plan which was 2 years in the making contemplates among other things a new system and fresh funds for accelerated land distribution from Apuches , compensation for victims of violence and funds and programs to activate economic development in the indigenous regions which are the poorest in the country . Many Mapuches applaud the proposal that at least gives constitutional recognition to Chile 's indigenous people and that would carry out an indigenous consultation in the short term . We think this is an improvement , but too many things are missing . For example , we say that we are part of a plurational system . We have the to autonomy , free determination of our people , and the respect for international treaties which are not mentioned here . At least 10 % of Chileians are Mapuches . And while not all are demanding land , the majority feel they 've been mistreated , exploited , and discriminated for centuries by Chileians of European descent . In the center of Santiago is the statue of Pedro de Valdivia , the Spanish concistador who tried and failed to conquer the Mapuches 500 years ago . In fact , they captured and killed him , forcing the Spaniards to make a deal with the Mapuches that everything south of the Boio River would belong to them . But 200 years ago , when Chile became a republic , the deal was off . And the conflict between the Mapuches and Chile has lasted till this day . The new peace commission plan is rejected by many white land owners who say it goes too far and by most radical mapuchas who dismiss it as hot air . But Bodich called on Chileians to support it , saying it 's the most ambitious proposal to date . I am convinced that it is a unique opportunity to reach peace and justice that will not be repeated . But with less than a year in office to go , it will fall on the next administration to implement most of the plan or as has happened in the past to shel it . Lucian Newman , Al Jazera , Santiago .

The Trump administration 's attempt to revoke their visas blocked by a federal judge as she considers the university 's lawsuit . The school 's president , Alan Garber , said in a statement , "" We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action . It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who 've come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams . The move is just the latest in a series of actions targeting the Ivy League institution accused by the Trump administration of anti - semitism and coordinating with foreign governments . Harvard is also fighting to reinstate nearly $ 3 billion in cuts to federal grant funding , which it argues is retaliation for maintaining academic independence in the face of government pressure . The international students , I think , are really terrified to be frank . They are residents of this country and this community and all of a sudden they 're being told that they ca n't be here anymore . And I think a lot of them feel they 're a pawn in the political vendetta that the Trump administration has against Harvard . Elite schools Harvard may be the target of the Trump administration , but the impact of this lawsuit could be farreaching . Nationwide , more than a million international students attend US colleges and universities . More than a quarter of Harvard student population comes from another country . Leo Jerarden from Sweden is set to graduate in one week 's time . I 'm leaving a place that might look very different next year . And it 's already starting to look very different because people because of all the fear that people experience because of the visa revocations and the detentions of international students . Fewer people want to speak up . Fewer people want to participate in protests , want to write ops in the student newspaper .

When rights activist Bonafas Wangi was found near Kenya 's border with Tanzania , he could barely stand up . He was arrested in Tanzania on Monday along with a Ugandan lawyer Agata Atuhari . I have gone through very four dark days . I have been tortured very badly . I can barely walk . But I 'm very concerned about Agatha cuz we were tortured together .

His supporters say there 's a growing regional crisis of democracy . Very concerned about the shrinking democratic space in the East African region . We have seen that in Uganda .

There is children 's paying fees of your children your shelter anything concerning life . So you is inside salary . In some factories conditions are even tougher . Many people work for even less pay . From universities to banks and hospitals , most Nigerian workers hardly earn enough to feed their families . As a result , thousands have left the country in the last 5 years to find better prospects , including 16,000 doctors . One union leader says even if monthly minimum wage was raised to a million naira , about $ 630 , people will still struggle to make ends meet . Now the only thing to do is that for the managers of the economy is to address inflation , address the value of the currency and then it will make sense . In 2024 , protesters took to the streets in Nigeria to demand government action to ease the cost of living . Organizers blamed government 's economic policies that included ending decades of petrol subsidies and the devaluation of the local currency . The Nigerian government announced a 120 % wage increase in 2024 . One year after , tens of thousands of workers are yet to benefit from the increase . Since the review , food inflation and hikes in cost of fuel and transportation have eroded whatever they gained from the new minimum wage . The government says it has introduced measures to ease the hardship , but labor leaders dismiss them as inadequate . They say the country is now at crossroads . The implication is that productivity will go down . The implication is that poverty will be the order of the day . Another wage review is due in 2 years when the government and labor leaders are due to meet . Until then , Nigerian workers will have to find ways to survive the cost of living crisis that has wiped out much of the country 's middle class . Ahmed , Al Jazzer , Abuja .

Thank you very much for your time . So that these talks are taking place just days after US officials said they want Iran not just to scale back its nuclear program but to stop enriching uranium altogether and Fedan has said that is a non - starter . So how do you assess the prospects for these talks ? So under the original nuclear deal , Iran was allowed to enrich uranium up to 3.67 % . now , however , however , the Trump administration is demanding zero enrichment and that does have the potential to lead to the collapse of the talks . That has been a red line for Iran for over 20 years now . And I think it 's a red line that is very difficult to change . and perhaps the supreme leader will not allow that . , one idea that has been thrown around as a possible solution is the establishment of a consortium of countries perhaps made up of Iran , Saudi Arabia , the UAE , even the Americans that would enrich uranium jointly . However , even regarding that idea , there is disagreement . Iran is insisting that the consortium should enrich uranium on Iranian soil . However , the Americans want it to be done in a third country . . , ultimately , however , I think the two sides do not want the talks to collapse . It 's interesting you 're talking about the red line . How difficult is it from the Iranian perspective that the red line does seem to be shifting because the American side saying that they do n't want uranium to be enriched , , even to the 3 point something% . that is something that they are moving as well so when the talks originally started they made no such demand and that 's why there was so much optimism regarding the talks however in the past two weeks we 've heard from American officials that they want zero enrichment which is essentially the Israeli position on the Iranian side however we 've seen no signs that they are willing to accept such a Man , we have to understand that it 's also an issue of national pride for the Iranians . , , the nuclear program has developed for over 20 years and what the Americans are demanding now is a complete shutdown of that program . What the Iranian side is saying is that they are willing to limit that program . So , we 'll have to wait and see what happens . And Donald Trump is has repeatedly threatened Iran with military action if the two countries do n't reach a deal . stressing that he wo n't allow Thran to obtain a nuclear weapon . What impact , if any , do such threats having on the talks ? , so we 've heard that rhetoric both from the Trump administration , but even more so from the Israelis . , nobody really knows if they are serious regarding that threat and they are planning to bomb Iran 's nuclear facilities or maybe perhaps it 's psychological operation trying to pressure Iran to give more concessions on the negotiating table . , ultimately though time is of the essence because the snapback mechanism expires in October of this year . So we 'll have to have a deal by the end of the summer or things will start to deteriorate very quickly . . The snapback mechanism that you 're mentioning is part of the last nuclear deal , is n't it ? that Iran signed with six world powers and Iran has held meetings with European with a European delegation recently because of the threat from the Europeans of using what 's called the snapback mechanism which is to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran . Do you think that is putting any pressure on Iran ? I do think it 's very important . the Europeans have told the Iranians that they are going to trigger that mechanism in August if a nuclear deal is not reached . However , the problem is we have to remember that the original deal took 2 years to negotiate . So having such a short timeline is complicating matters to a very far extent . , one possible solution would be to reach a temporary deal and then negotiate towards a more comprehensive deal in the future .

Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas , the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization or PLO , which once ran a state within a state in the 1980s . Today , attending an event with former Lebanese President Amin , whose party had been in conflict with the Palestinians . Also here , Lebanon 's new leadership that no longer wants the armed presence of Palestinian factions in the country . In Lebanon , Abbas adopted a responsible approach , respecting Lebanon 's sovereignty and rejecting any armed manifestations within the camps . Lebanon has been home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees living in overcrowded camps in what became built up areas under a decades old agreement . These camps are outside the state 's jurisdiction and security inside is managed by Palestinian factions . While in Beirut , Abbas said that 's going to change . Palestinian refugee camps are under the sovereignty of the Lebanese state . the Lebanese army and Lebanese security . Those weapons hurt Lebanon and the Palestinian cause . And while Abbas 's Palestinian Authority may be recognized internationally as the representative body of the Palestinian people , there are many armed groups . Among them , Hamas and Islamic Jihad , who unlike the PLO , believe in armed struggle against Israel . They have rejected any unilateral move to disarm groups and believe the issue is linked to the Palestinians to return to their homeland , the to protection , and the to their political presence . But it appears Abbasa 's visit to Beirut has formally launched a process of disarmament . A joint Lebanese Palestinian committee is to hold meetings and agree on a way to do that . The message is clear . There is a new era , a new balance of power , and a new leadership in Lebanon , which is pushing ahead with monopolizing arms in the hands of the state . It has already begun to dismantle Hezbollah 's military infrastructure in southern Lebanon . And the next phase appears to be the disarmament of Palestinian groups in camps before it addresses the issue of Hezbollah 's weapons in the rest of the country . Hezbollah may have been militarily weakened in its war with Israel last year , and its Palestinian allies no longer have political and military cover , but the PLO is not the most powerful nor the most popular faction .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Donald Trump and the US Attorney General , thanking them for their efforts to crack down on pro Palestinian protesters .

I want to be really clear that what is happening now with using anti - semitism as an excuse specifically to crack down and on institutions of higher learning that is not acceptable to the vast majority of American Jews .

Peru has always denied it was an abusive policy , saying women knowingly and willingly took part of the program . Rights groups want the interamerican court to determine that the crimes against reproductive health should be considered as crimes against humanity because they say in the case of Peru , they were massive and systematic . This case will set jurist prudence for thousands of women left unable to bear children . Many Donia suffered mentally and physically and faced cultural retribution .

We 're taking you live now to the US and that is where President Trump is speaking now at a Make America Healthy Again event . Let 's listen in . Healthy Again . And today the commission officially delivers its first report on childhood health . Here are just some of the alarming findings . And they really are alarming . It 's unbelievable . Terrible . More than 40 % of American children now have at least one chronic health condition . Since the 1970 , rates of childhood cancer have soared in many cases by nearly 50 % , 50 % . , in the 1960s , less than 5 % of the children were obese . Now over 20 % are obese . A few decades ago , one in one , think of this one . This is to me the one that gets me every time . And it seems to be getting worse . Just a few decades ago , one in 10,000 children had autism . Today , it 's 1 in 31 . Last time I heard the number was 1 in 34 . now , it 's 1 in 31 . There 's something wrong . And we will not stop until we defeat the chronic disease epidemic in America . We 're going to get it done . For the first time ever , this report examines some of the root causes that many believe are making our children sicker and our population sicker . I guess it just does n't stop with the children . It 's our population also , such as the ultrarocessed foods , over medicicalization , and over prescription and widespread exposure to potentially toxic chemicals . Unlike other administrations , we will not be silenced or intimidated by the corporate lobbyists or special interests . And I want this group to do what they have to do . We have to spell it out . In some cases , it wo n't be nice or it wo n't be pretty , but we have to do it . When you hear when you hear 10,000 , it was one in 10,000 and now it 's one in 31 for autism . I think that 's just a terrible thing . It has to be something on the outside . Has to be artificially induced . has to be and will not allow our public health system to be captured by the very industries it 's supposed to oversee . So , we 're demanding the answers . The public is demanding the answers and that 's why we 're here already . We 're phasing out eight of the most common artificial food dyes . And we ended the most serious conflicts of interest at the FDA . We had a lot of conflicts over there . Earlier this week , we approved a SNAP waiver request from Nebraska so they can stop taxpayer dollars from being used to make our children obese . I understand requests from three more states will be approved shortly and more are expected to come in the following weeks . Over the next 80 days , the commission will build on its work in this report to develop a roadmap to bold and transformative public health reforms for our consideration . It 's a consideration and we 'll lay out the facts . Let me say congratulations to the entire Maha movement . This movement has become very hot . People are people are really I tell you they going crazy over Maha . They 're going crazy , ? And I look forward to continuing the historic progress . And I will say this , this whole group , this whole table , they 're very , , I use a word that 's because it 's a beautiful word . , the Democrats took it and they used it instead of the word liberal . They used the word progressive . And normally I 'd say you 're very progressive , meaning you 're far . They 're not progressive . You are progressive . They should n't be allowed to use that word . And I 'm That 's . And so therefore , I 'm not going to use it to describe you , but you are far forward thinkers . You 're amazing thinkers , and we appreciate having this tremendous talent around this table , the most respected people anywhere in the world , . And and , I 've I 've been a fan of Bobby for years . He came up to see me 13 , 14 , 15 years ago , I remember , and he left . And I made a couple of the statements that he made cuz I agreed with the same thing and we both went through hell . Do you remember that ? It was a massive but what ? We turned out to be . It was interesting . But I 've been a friend of Bobby and he 's been a foe too . he 's tried to stop a couple of my jobs . In one case he did stop a job and I was really angry and then about four months later that we went into a depression and I saved a hell of a lot of money by the fact that you stopped . You 're welcome . So , I never minded it . I always said , "" Thank you very much for stopping that big job I was going to do . "" But he 's a fantastic guy . And Bobby , we 're with you all the way . And your beautiful wife is sitting in the front row . And she 's always been there with you . And , it was very interesting when Bobby came . I really wanted Bobby to join . And he was doing very well as a candidate . Really well . He was being treated very unfairly by the other side , but he was doing so well that they treated you unfairly . They had no choice . I think they said in order to qualify , N you had to have 80 % of the vote . ? Do you remember that deal ? You had to have 80 % of the vote in order to qualify to run against Joe Biden . And Bobby thought that was a little unfair and that was about it . And he came on board and we got very lucky . But you really helped and I want to thank you very much . Really , we 're with you . Thank you very much . So , so Bobby , if you 'd say give him give him your thoughts , . , thank you very much , Mr. President . And I do want to say something because I get a lot of credit for steering this administration toward the Mahaba movement . And but I joined the campaign in August . I joined President Trump in August and became , , went from independent to his campaign . that was a scene in Washington DC this hour where the US President Donald Trump was speaking at what he calls a make America healthy again event . we 'll bring in our correspondent Shiha Bratani who 's joining us from Washington DC . So just talk us through what we heard and what was the takeaway message from all of that . One of the reasons why this is going to be so interesting , this campaign to maha , make America healthy again , along with making America great again , MAGA , is it 's going to be a really interesting case study in the rhetoric of the administration versus the versus the reality . You have Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He 's just published a report from his Maha Commission which is elucidating the health care problems the health issues of America 's young and they 're things which on all sides of the political spectrum people agree on ultrarocessed foods exposure to chemicals lack of exercise over prescription of drugs these are real problems and they 're having real world health effects negative health effects on young people . What 's happening though , he 's released this report . He 's saying he 's not going to release some agenda to address these issues for another 100 days . And in the meantime , in a classic Washington fashion , the people who are responsible for ultrarocessed foods , overprescription of drugs , toxins in our air , are spending a fortune in Congress , on Capitol Hill , and within on , , just generally in lobbying the Trump administration as they 've traditionally done with both Republican and Democratic administrations to ensure that nothing is really done . They rely on ultra they 're the ones who are peddling all this stuff and they 're enormously influential big agriculture big farmer big pharmaceutical and big food . So this is going to be this tussle and already we 're seeing though despite RFK Robert F. Kennedy Jr. there saying look these are the problems . He 's already stepping back . This report does n't have the stridident language that we 're being told that what that might have been affected and that RFK has used in the past . Already we 're seeing a lot of the changes that may be recommended may be voluntary and not prescribed . And in fact , even as they 're talking about improving the health care of the young , the big beautiful bill that was passed this morning in the House , the main budgetary taxation proposal from the Trump administration is slashing health care for the poorest in society . So these are the contradictions which come to the surface when we talk about the Trump administration making America healthy again . , thank you so much Sheihansi reporting from Washington DC ."

For more than a decade , many other businesses in Syria , they reeled under trade restrictions due to international sanctions that banned investment in the country and curbed financial transactions . But now they say the EU agreeing to lift sanctions will help them overcome previous operational hurdles . The main obstacle we faced was getting raw materials in automated lines , especially that we could n't import any equipment or industry lines because of the sanctions . So , we had to rely heavily on manpower . As for bank accounts , we were n't able to send or receive any transactions because of the sanctions . Business owners and shoppers have reacted to the EU 's announcement on lifting of sanctions with optimism and hope . Companies that were ousted from Syria and stopped dealing with us because of the sanctions are now in contact with us . Many companies and producers are telling us that they are coming back and they want to reserve a spot in our market . Among the potential economic benefits to Syrian businesses are a reintegration into the global economy and the chance to attract foreign investment . Syrian banks can also reconnect to international financial systems . The government views the EU 's move as more of a recognition of the new political leadership in Syria that can help integrate the country back into the international community . But for this to happen , the UN emphasizes the need for the dissolution of armed groups and implementation of a transitional justice system to investigate crimes committed during the rule of the Assad regime . Syrian officials have publicly promised to bring in human rights reforms and set up a transitional justice commission . The European Union 's announcement came after US President Donald Trump announced plans to remove US sanctions on Syria earlier this month . The EU began imposing sanctions on Syria in 2011 , shortly after the Assad regime launched a crackdown on protesters . The move to lift the sanctions is aimed at improving Syria 's economy under its new leadership , but sanctions targeting individuals associated with the former Assad regime , human rights violators , and the country 's arms trade remain in place .

https://youtu.be/rU6Wy8l_51s?si=n4b1T0krtecCk5_x,This US university student is on a hunger strike over Gaza,Al Jazeera English,rU6Wy8l_51s,"The number one question I get on this account on a daily basis is people saying , "" I do n't have enough money to donate to Palestine . Are there other I am a thirdyear Palestinian UCLA student , and today marks the first day of my indefinite hunger strike in protest of my university 's direct involvement of my people 's genocide . And today is day three of my hunger strike in protest of my university , UCLA 's complicity in my terrorized by Zionist . "" I felt , , over the last nearly two years , we have tried every form of protest , political , non - political . I thought that putting our bodies on the line was the next step in fighting for liberation . A lot of people do n't know that UCLA directly and indirectly invests hundreds of billions of dollars into every aspect of the Palestinian genocide . From the gas that is going into the tanks that are running Palestinian bodies over to the companies who are tracking down the journalists , the spyware companies . I just talked to the UCLA newspaper . I 'm talking to LA News and Bigger News this [ Music ] I hit day five , six , seven without any food , the body just the mental torture that your body starts experiencing . It 's it 's it 's insane . And it really gave me just more insight into just how disgusting and torturous the Israeli government is being by admittedly purposely starving the people of Gaza . You start to feel extremely isolated and alone and scared and sad and your body is just begging you to eat something . The only way I was surviving was by drinking two full lers of water a day with electrolytes . And the people of Gaza are drinking water with parasites and dirt and sediment in it . So that really encouraged me to keep going and speaking out about my campus 's complicity . Before I say anything in this video , I want to say thank you to everybody who 's checked up on me . Though there has been no response from UCLA about my hunger strike , I have been made aware that they know about the strike . Today is day seven of my hunger strike at UCLA and it is the 77th anniversary of the Palestinian NECBA . 77 years ago in 1948 , over 750,000 Palestinians were kicked out of their homes and their countries by violent Israeli colonizers . I had multiple students come up to me and they would tell me , "" I saw your video on my for you page . I 'm so inspired . Keep doing what you 're doing . "" Joined us on hunger strike , got one of the biggest grocery stores in the UK 's co - op to vote to see Strike and already raised $ 180,000 . And I 've not eaten anything in over 138 hours . Today , we achieved our goal to raise 100 . Today , I fasted from one meal and donated the money that I did n't spend on food to feed Palestinians in Gaza . I 'm currently doing a hunger strike to stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza . As it has been over 70 days and there 's not been a single humanitarian aid truck let into the Gaza Strip . You all know us as comedy content creators , but today we want to use our platform and our voice to talk about the Fast for Gaza challenge . I think a shortcoming of current American activism is the idea that if you ca n't plan out some huge event that 's going to really show them how we feel , then you ca n't do anything . And that is just so untrue . Everything we 're seeing now is a culmination of decades of liberation . , we did n't get to this point simply because of the things we did two years ago . It 's it 's my data 75 years ago , , starting this and my ancestors and the people in my family fighting against this and planting the seeds for me to be able to do something . So even if you do n't believe that you can have a big impact , plant those seeds now so the future generations can continue to fight for liberation . [ Music ]"

But to get out , they need letters of verification confirming their qualifications . They accuse the government of stalling . It 's hard to get the verification letter because the ministry has to write a letter to the NS council for you to get that verification letter . And this has caused a lot of corruption because some people will be charging more than $ 2,000 for that verification letter to be given . In recent years , thousands of Zimbabwean health workers have migrated to countries such as the UK , Australia , and Canada . Health officials are worried about the rising number of skilled and educated people leaving the country . We ca n't be training for the developed world . So this is how we come up with ways of trying to retain workers but we are not trying to force people to say do n't go and so we have to improve also the working conditions so that it becomes attractive for them to remain here . Activists have started petitions to try and pressure the government to improve services . You practically have to buy everything . The doctor just give you a prescription . You buy everything from your own drip . the needle that is used for you to get your injections , your biio medicine from outsidearmacies . Unions say the lowest paid nurse takes home less than $ 300 a month after tax , leaving them struggling to make ends meet and making it harder to retain staff . This is the largest public hospital in the country . The health ministry says it 's going to improve conditions here with funding from countries such as Barus . But some people are skeptical , saying the public health sector has struggled for decades because of corruption and a lack of political will . Many health workers have little hope their conditions will improve . And as some countries in the West get tougher on immigration , those who want to leave say they need their clearance papers if they are to have any chance of finding better opportunities abroad .

The viral fever causes severe joint pain and left them feeling weak and exhausted . When you get chicken , you ca n't get out of bed , you ca n't walk , and if you sit , you ca n't stand up . You ca n't even go to the doctor . It makes you cry . It 's so painful . Health authorities in Sri Lanka are trying hard to contain the outbreak , the first since 2006 . They are stretched as another viral fever , deni is also spreading . We are inspecting inside and outside of the premises for any mosquito breeding . The ads mosquito carries both viruses that can be passed on when the insect bites a person . Patients also spread the diseases when they are bitten and the mosquito can go on to bite other people . 1.5 million people live in the city of Columbbo that covers 37 square kilometers and medical workers are concerned that chicken ga and deni could spread rapidly there . Mosquito can roam around 200 m radius . So in the 200 m radius in this settings we 'll have around 100 to 500 people . So if you have a dingi patient he can he or she can spread to around 100 500 people . Health authorities here do n't know how many people have been infected this time round though sources tell alazer the number is significant but infections are heavily under reportported . Scientists want to know how many mosquitoes carry the virus . They 're also trying to determine if and how the mosquito - born viruses mutate and affect humans . The University of Sri Jaba Dunanpur is studying the chicken gona virus that has been spreading in the Indian region in recent years . There is very limited poor understanding of what chicken gona does to the body . So we are looking at what when you 're getting infected with chicken gona , why do people get joint pain ? why do some people have liver dysfunction ? So we are trying to answer these questions . Those contracting the illness will be hoping these studies help combat the disease and provide relief to those who catch it . Min Fernandez , Alazer , Colbo .

Salha was the last remaining RSF stronghold in the capital . The army declared Kartum free of the paramilitary on Tuesday , a residential area just over two years ago . Now the streets bear the signs of the battles that took place here in recent days . Sudani . We want to give the good news to the Sudin people about our great victories . Al Salah , which was the last hold out of the RSF , was a challenge , but here we are now and will continue to fight until , the leadership said , we take back other areas . The army says it was not only able to take back territory , but also military equipment that belong to the RSF , including several jamming devices and drones . Sudan 's army , which has been fighting the RSF for more than 2 years , has been making major gains in the capital in the past months . Its biggest advance was in late March when it took back the presidential palace and the country 's main airport as well as residential areas . Alsa was one of the first areas to be captured by the RSF , displacing most of its residents , but some stayed behind . We lived in misery . They beat my aunts . I have an uncle who was killed and we bore daily humiliation . We lived in fear and terror . Were the only ones who were left behind . We had no one else with us . Then the army came and told us to evacuate and we did . The army says these dead bodies are RSF fighters left on the streets a day after they took control of Sala . The army 's full control over Kartum does n't mean the war is ended . The RSF still has control of most of the western region of Darur and parts of southwestern Sudan . But the conflict seems to have changed from the RSF fighting for control of Sudan to fighting to ensure it does n't lose any more ground . Hiba Morgan Alazer Kartum .

Before there were 20 or 30 people in need . Now they 're 150 to 160 . One of them is 59year - old Danielle Antonio Choke who walked more than 20 kilometers to get something to eat this morning . He carries all his belongings including the blanket he uses to sleep on the street . He explains he lost his job loading sacks of sand two years ago when he injured his back . Look , this is my name on the form for a program to help the disabled , but the person who is supposed to register me is never there . She 's paid not to work , while many people , too many people me are suffering . Nearby , another sign of Bolivia 's acute economic decay . Hundreds of cars lined up for endless blocks . Their owners desperate to buy petrol before it runs out . The owner of this car has been waiting for 5 hours in the queue to fill his tank . Petrol in this country is subsidized . 70 cents per liter , which is the cheapest in Latin America . So , the problem here is n't the price , it 's the scarcity of fuel . And that means that the government has to import it with dollars , which is something this country does n't have . Bolivia 's central bank is broke because it ran out of gas , the country 's main export . 11 years ago , Bolivia exported $ 6.5 billion dollar worth of natural gas . But now it 's less than 1.5 billion . In 2014 , for reasons that are incomprehensible , investment in the gas industry went down and therefore production started dropping . We did n't explore for new sources . With US dollars on the black market so scarce they cost three times the official rate . Double - digit inflation is soaring . People at this market look but ca n't buy . Food is too expensive . So we eat bread with tea . We the poor eat only bread with tea . And what does the president eat ? Whatever he wants .

https://youtu.be/Bd_XUnbkmHY?si=ZWclsPhNr6tzNaxm,Gaza hunger: UN says one in five Palestinians facing starvation,Al Jazeera English,Bd_XUnbkmHY,"As we mentioned , Israel 's 11week blockade has impacted every corner of Gaza . Food , water , and medicine have been prevented from entering the strip . The United Nations has warned that thousands of children in Gaza are at risk of death because of the Israeli blockade . Near famine conditions haunt the entire population that 's been repeatedly displaced in Gaza . , in the last hour , the UN has confirmed that around 90 truckloads of goods have been dispatched to Gaza . Let 's speak to Gabriel Alzando , who 's at the UN headquarters in New York , , and is live for us . Gabe , what more do we know about these aid trucks and the process Israel has put in place , , to make sure the aid gets to those who need it ? , first the facts as we know them from the United Nations as you stated , they are confirming within the last hour that 90 trucks have got to their distribution points in Gaza and some aid is starting to be distributed . Now , what aid is that ? The UN most recently in their last information we 're hearing they 're they 're saying we 're not giving specifics . However , we 've heard from UN officials in the last 24 to 36 hours before these trucks arrive saying that they believe it will be flour , some medicine , nutritional supplies , and some baby formula . but in terms of details on how much flour , when and where exactly it 's being distributed , the UN simply is saying they do not have that info at this hour . What we can tell you is the UN is saying that no petroleum or gasoline is being allowed into Gaza by Israeli authorities . that is important because that means there 's no gasoline to power generators for hospitals or even bakeries to keep ovens running and things that . Israel continues to block that . Also , of course , it is very important to point out while 90 trucks might seem a big number , it 's really not . And this is why is because before October 7th , 2023 , before Israel began its bombardment of the Gaza Strip , about 5 to 600 aid trucks were going into Gaza every day . Again , that 's before Israel began its bombardment of the Gaza Strip . And so 90 trucks simply in the words of UN officials is a drop in the ocean , particularly since it 's now been 11 weeks that Israel had a total and complete blockade on all aid . So this is essentially where we 're at . UN officials certainly are not celebrating , but they are saying a little bit of a sigh of relief because they say they will take any aid they can to get in , even to save one life , but clearly this is nowhere even close to the amount that is needed . , many thanks for that . Gabrielando there for us at UN headquarters in New York ."
https://youtu.be/BSH9y7GMsKM?si=8uGrMFdiNYetQblA,Ramaphosa again strikes positive tone after Trump meeting,Al Jazeera English,BSH9y7GMsKM,"Taking you live to DC , South Africa 's President Siril Ramaposa is speaking , giving an update after his meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House . Let 's listen in for a moment . did n't dwell on that issue , it having been dealt with more thoroughly during the engagement in the Oval Office . However , they did ask what help do you need and we said already in South Africa we utilizing some technology in one of the areas in our country which we would to see if we can be utilized and but the main thing we said in terms of assistance and help is investments and we harped on that we require more investments from the United States and we require a more positive disposition from the United States because once the United States government and the president emits a very positive disposition towards South Africa , it unlocks a lot of investments and investors would then be willing to come and invest their money . We want foreign direct investment . We want to keep the jobs that we have that have been created by US companies . And we want more and more US companies to come and invest . And Minister Tao also explained that one of the US companies has invested in a lithium company in our country and that shows a positive disposition towards South Africa . We want that to increase . And one of the key confidence building measures or mechanisms is the engagement that is going to continue on investments on tariffs and an investment climate creation in South Africa and our access to the American market and continued discussions of AGOA are now going to ensue much more determinedly going forward . So for us during the lunch discussion that was the big takeaway a very positive indication . Of course we could n't discuss details because those details will be ironed out during those engagements . Secretary of Commerce was present as Minister of Trade and Industry was also present . We also discussed the G20 and we stressed that the G20 having been formed by the United States of course together with other countries it 's important that the United States should continue playing a key role in the G20 more particularly because I want to hand over the presidency of the G20 to President Trump in November and I said he needs to be there . I do n't want to hand over the presidency of the G20 to an empty chair . I want to hand it over to him sitting in that chair in November and he is going to give serious consideration to it . In fact , I expect him to be coming to South Africa and he having realized the important role that the United States continues to play in international or multilateral formations or organizations the G7 and the G20 . And he having said of course the G7 u would be much more impactful with the participation of the United States as the G20 would be more impactful in global matters with the participation of the largest economy in the world . So my take away from that is that u G20 participation by the United States is going to be happening . So we particularly pleased with that and in the other discussions that will happen in various channels which are also led by Minister Lamula , we will also be dealing with their participation in the various committees and various summits that are taking place on an ongoing basis because there was a pullback . So we want them to re - engage and those discussions will then go forward . So all in all I do believe that our visit here has been a great success . we 've been able to achieve what we set out to achieve to achieve re - engagement with the US to put the issues of investment and trade on the table and to ensure that we continue engaging through the various other formations . It 's good that his secretary of commerce was sitting next to him and they continued exchanging how our continued in engagement will happen . So all in all I 'm rather pleased I go back tonight having a sense that we have done well . I know that many South Africans were filled with a great deal of concern and fear that we will have a Zed moment and all that did not ensue and I know that you yourselves as the media you wanted to see drama and something really big happening and I 'm sorry that we disappointed you somewhat when it comes to that . So , but thank you very much for having for a number of you come all the way from home to the White House and I 'm rather glad that they allowed you to come into the Oval Office and that in itself was good and they gave us a number of momentos and I was given a book so I gave him a book a golf book and he gave me a book as well . So that is good . Lots of reading in the future . Lots of reading indeed in the future . Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you very much , Mr. President"

Artificial intelligence especially is driving many weapons companies towards an unmanned future . Are we going to see the end of pilots , human pilots ? I got no job . Aviation businesses now focusing on unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs . We still need a pilot because the UAV is just a thing that directed by human to the weapons manufacturers turning to guns that do n't need soldiers to fire them . We are looking for the future and we are seeing that the unmanned systems will be the main major player of the modern battlefields . The race to keep up with technology underpins a lot of the deal making at this exhibition . combined with increasing defense spending in response to rising regional tensions . The budget for the defense industry has increased not just in Malaysia and also within this region . Is is a good sign for us . So hence we have we have a lot of work to do . Conflicts and diplomatic upheavalss also impact international arm sales with the war in Ukraine significantly hurting Russian arms exports while the fallout from the US trade tariffs is making some potential buyers of American weaponry look elsewhere .

A surprising victory for Chinese technology that China seemingly does n't want to talk about .

Armed Palestinian factions are in charge of refugee camps . It 's been this way for decades as part of a controversial agreement that legalized their presence and allowed them to engage in armed struggle against Israel . Now there is a new leadership in the country that wants to ensure only the state holds weapons and they are talking to Mahmud Abbas , the president of the Palestinian Authority . According to officials here , he 's told Lebanon he supports state control over the camps . He is expected in Beirut to finalize a way to dismantle the military infrastructure of the different factions inside the camps . But the Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO is not the only authority here . Groups Hamas , Islamic Jihad , and others are key players , and their choice of armed resistance against Israel is popular among many Palestinians in Lebanon . They say they have not been officially informed by the state about any request regarding weapons , but when it happens , they will respond with a united Palestinian position that respects Lebanese sovereignty and Palestinian interests . The issue of Palestinian weapons have long been divisive here . For Palestinians , they symbolize their resistance and struggle to return to their homeland . For others in Lebanon , they are a source of instability . Palestinians have a long history in Lebanon . There was a time when they ran a state within a state and conducted crossber raids into Israel that triggered reprisals . They also played a role in Lebanon 's civil war . There were also dark chapters when hundreds of Palestinians were killed by Lebanese militia coordinating with the Israeli army during the infamous Sabra and Chhatila massacres in Beirut in 1982 . And that is why the idea of disarmament makes many people feel vulnerable . The timing too is causing concern . Palestinians say it is part of a campaign to create a new reality , dismantling everything related to their cause , not just here , but across the region and the beginning of the end of resistance to Israel .

https://youtu.be/qt4i5qdfHbo?si=aMfZ4bEokqbdewRq,Pakistan school bus blast: At least 3 children killed in Balochistan province,Al Jazeera English,qt4i5qdfHbo,"The Pakistani military says five people , including three children , have been killed in an explosion in the Baluchistan province of Pakistan . A bus carrying students from the army public school was targeted by an improvised explosive device . No armed group has claimed responsibility for the attack that also injured dozens of students . Baluchasan has been plagued with violence with several separatist groups staging attacks against security forces and civilians . Let 's get more on the story now with Kamal Haida who 's live for us in Islamabad . Kamar , what more details are emerging about this attack ? The reports that are coming in say that there was an explosive device planted in a vehicle which was parked on the roadside and that targeted the bus which was carrying those school children . Now the military of course is saying that this is an act which is being carried out at the behest of India . They have blamed India for it . However , we are also finding out more details that there are number of children who are wounded . They 're being taken care of at the combined military hospital in Kuldar and this is about 302 kilometers from the provincial capital Queta and Kamal no claim of responsibility as yet . We know there are multiple separatist groups operating in Pakistan . Blue Chisian of course no stranger to separatist violence . I imagine Pakistan 's intelligence service is being extra vigilant . Absolutely . If you remember there was a deadly attack in March in which hundreds of passengers were taken hostage on a train the Jaffer Express . Baljasthan has seen many attacks targeting Chinese engineers and also the fact that the Baluch Liberation Army which is a banned outfit has normally taken responsibility for these attacks . Pakistan says that these groups are funded by the Indian intelligence agency .

Fighting broke out here between government forces and armed groups last week . Abdul Khanil Kiki , also known as Gana , the leader of one of the most powerful armed groups in western Libya , the Stability Support Authority , was killed last Monday . The SSA has since collapsed . for any person or group who will kidnap , kill , or blackmail by threatening the use of force or kidnapping . God willing , we will no longer allow that . We have broken the barrier of fear . The government said it conducted the security operation to take control of SSA facilities in and around the Abuim area , one of the most densely populated in the capital . This former SSA base in Abuim has now been taken over by government forces . Human rights groups accused the group of committing human rights violation and crimes under international law . The government says it has found mass graves in areas that had been controlled by the group and has exumed several bodies from locations this . Mahmud Shalabi is a regional researcher at Amnesty International . He says they investigated crimes committed by the SSA . We found that Libyan detinees who were held in facilities controlled by the SSA were held in poorly ventilated and overcrowded cells . They were subjected to mock executions , food deprivation , beatings , torture . The facility guard authority was closely allied to the SSA . It was also dissolved in the government operation . This is one of several security bases in Tripoli that used to belong to the SSA or affiliated armed groups , but is now under control of the government . People now feel safe enough to talk about the crimes committed against them . Ahmed Alles says he was kidnapped at a coffee shop near his home by armed men and brought here . He says his crime was supporting a rival football club . They tied me up and beat me horrifically . Then they told me that they kidnapped my mother and that they were going to bring her here and do things to her in front of me . I believed them . This militia was capable of doing worse than that . Ahmed says he is lucky to be alive and in the past he was too scared to tell government authorities what happened to him . Now he and many other victims of the SSA have a chance to get justice and maybe some long- aaited closure . Malatrina Elazer Tripoli .

The announcement comes nearly two months after the military captured the capital . Sudan 's army and the RSF have been fighting for control for more than 2 years . The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people . Aid agencies say the country is facing the world 's worst humanitarian crisis . Hiba Morgan has the latest from Kartum . The announcement by the Sudin army that the capital is now under its full control and free from rebels as per their words comes after days of heavy battles between the Sudin army and the paramilitary rapid support forces in a Salha area in southern Umur . Now a Sala in the capital Hum was the last remaining major RSF stronghold and home to one of its largest military bases . The army has been making gradual advances in also over the past few days until it was able to take control of the area completely from the paramilitary rapid support forces in the early hours of Tuesday morning . The army also said it was able to recover weapons and ammunitions that were used by the paramilitary including drones and jamming systems that have been in possession of the paramilitary rapid support forces . We have seen the conflict evolving over the past few months between the rapid support forces and the Sudanese army with more and more drones being used by both waring parties . But the rapid support forces has been escalating its use of drones and jamming systems over the past few weeks , including using the drones to target areas that have been previously free from conflict since the start of the fighting in April 2023 . Now , the Sudin army says it will continue its battles against the paramilitary rapid support forces and chase the RSF in areas that they currently control until it regains controls of those territories . And those territories include southwestern parts of the country and the western region of Darur , which is nearly under the full control of the RSF . Battles will likely continue between the two sides even as the United Nations has called for a halt , a temporary halt of fighting and to allow for humanitarian assistance to reach those affected by the conflict . The army says it will continue pursuing the RSF and the RSF seems to be determined to maintain control of the territories that it still has control of such as the western parts of Darur and southwestern parts of Kuruan which they currently are battling the army for its control .

",Al Jazeera English,xhUOBs-aYII,"Syria is hoping to showcase its art to the world after that lifting of European sanctions . It has a rich creative history that 's largely been hidden in recent years . , here are some of the many paintings that might be seen at the Zoaya Gallery in Damascus . Some of the works , this one , they showcase the country 's recent troubled history , but others depict a more peaceful and orderly Syria before the war , of course . Now , this is a painting by Muhammad al- Mui . Now , this one , this is another by one of Syria 's most famous artists , Nabil Asaman . others , he 's hoping to be recognized by the wider art fraternity . Imran Khan reports now from Damascus . Zoaya Art Gallery is one of the main centers for art in Syria . It 's hidden away in a building above a law firm . It 's fitting considering that Syrian art has been hidden away from the world because of sanctions . Ruba Sulman hopes that isolation is about to end . It 's been a hard struggle for the gallery . We as galleries were n't able to participate in events outside the country and artists could n't leave the country or meet and learn from the experiences of other artists , creating some artistic isolation . In terms of buying and selling artworks , we had major complications . One of our customers who 's from Switzerland bought an art piece and wired the money to Lebanon . The Lebanese bank looked at our gallery up and blocked our account due to the fact that we were based in Damascus . And despite those challenges , as Syrian art struggled on , with the artists documenting their own experiences , some of the paintings in the gallery show a short history of Syria 's recent past . pre - war Syria , Syria at war , and the graffiti that sprung up after the Assad regime fell . For struggling artists , the news of sanctions relief is welcome . Gazanakal is an accomplished painter with gallery representation . Despite that , he 's had to struggle just to be able to create . He 's had to make his own paints . Quality paints are rarely available in the marketplace . I used to get powders that are n't specific for artworks , ones that were used for clothes dying or floor tiles , then put them on a stove top for a specific time , add sugar to make them stick , add a number of chemicals until I get the color that I wanted . All of this was because I could n't find the colors that I needed or supplies that I wanted . The domestic market for art is tiny because of the sanctions . People are more concerned with getting food on the table rather than art on the walls . But Syria has a rich artistic history . Damascus used to be a major center for art for centuries from Roman times to modern street art this . Sanctions made it invisible to the world . But now the opportunity arises to join the world creative stage and Syrian artists are ready to take their place upon it . Imran Khan , Alazer , Damascus .

https://youtu.be/3233JfQtrUQ?si=wbVn-hhk2LdHy7AK,Gaza's ongoing Nakba,Al Jazeera English,3233JfQtrUQ,"[ Music ] What happened in 1948 ? I remember my grandparents telling me story of people who left their homes under heavy bombardment , leaving everything behind . The massive similarities between the Nakba and what 's going on now with our people in Gaza . This is the second Nakba except it 's larger and it 's broadcasted live on television . I 'm Hani Mahmud , Al Jazzer , English correspondent in Gaza and Between Us . What began in 1948 never stopped . Gaza is living its Nakba now . Growing up in Gaza has shaped my experience and my life with what my grandparents , what my parents , what thousand of people went through from 1948 all the way to 2025 . Misery that keeps getting worse in each passing . So it 's not just a single event that we looked at and it happened and that 's it . But it went on for generations . For many of the families who are experiencing this for the second time , we 're talking about the third generation of families who are still refugees . For them , this is feeding into permanent displacement . It shaped their identity , shaped their way of thinking , shaped their experiences because there 's nothing pretty about being a refugee and searching for not only your civil rights but also your human rights . There are particular families here that are still holding the keys of their homes . They were forced to from in 1948 . We learned from the stories and the memories and the experiences that were passed down to us from the older generation that memory is power . And it just made us realize that our identity as Palestinians , it 's not in the in the things that we lost . It 's not in the things that our grandparents lost , but it 's in what we are unable to forget . That 's what makes us Palestinians . you want to go through your life every ordinary citizen around the world , but that 's not the case when it comes to the Palestinians . They passed down to experiences at the border lines , experiences in neighboring countries and that 's all because of the ongoing state of displacement and the fact that you made a refugee back in 1948 and this is still going on . Your status as a refugee never stopped , never ended . Now we 're living the worst of it . This is more of the pinnacle of or the catastrophe . 18 months of unfolding devastation and destruction . people in 1948 might have had the opportunity to seek refuge and a protection in different areas from one village to another . But now , Gaza is contained is completely blockaded with no exit out of this unfolding hell . People are going hungry . They 're going thirsty . 90 % of the population are living in tents now with more than 85 % of the residential buildings have been destroyed and wiped out completely . An entire inclav have turned into vast fields of rubble . It 's not just a failure of diplomacy , a failure of policy . It 's a failure of a humanity that is unable to protect and provide necessary safety for the children , for the women , for the elderly , for the vulnerable among them . We 're reporting from Gaza is such a huge responsibility . It started to take its emotional , physical , and psychological toll on me . the responsibility here to keep the memory alive here . And that 's what I 'm planning on doing , teaching my son and the children across the Gaza Strip . That the end result of ANCA was to erase the history of an entire population . But that did not happen because of Palestinians resilience and the fact that they do n't want to give up on their lands . The memory continued to happen and it continued to grow ."

In the north , the Indonesian Kamal Adwan , Ashifa Ali and Ala hospitals have been repeatedly targeted . In central and southern Gaza , Al Axa Hospital , the Nassau medical complex , and the European Gaza Hospital in Kyunas have also been hit . The World Health Organization says 686 attacks have been carried out on healthc care facilities since the war started . More than 90 % of hospitals in the strip have been damaged or destroyed , targeting medical facilities , staff , and patients , violates the 1949 Geneva Convention . It 's considered a war crime under international law . Cleaner is an emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders , and she 's joining me now from Gerala in Gaza . Thank you very much indeed for being with us . I understand that this is your first mission to Gaza , but you have worked in several different areas around the world where there are humanitarian crisis . Can you give us a description of how what you 're seeing in Gaza compares to what you have seen in other areas ? . What I 'm seeing in Gaza is nothing I 've ever seen before . It 's absolutely horrific the conditions people are living in and the way that they 're being forced to run for their lives repeatedly . Not just the population , but our staff are affected every day by this . And they 're not safe to work in the hospitals . They 're not safe to be going out and doing the water activities , providing safe water to the population every day . The space we 're working in is decreasing and our staff are being injured and are at risk of being killed . with the Israel 's blockade on Gaza and the restriction of food and fuel and medicine and getting in . one of the stories of course that we 've been reporting over the last several weeks has been the increasing amount of malnutrition and starvation that people are facing there . Can you just talk to us about the conditions that your teams are talk telling you about when it comes to the hunger and issues that people are facing ? , there 's been no food let in , no fuel , and no medical supplies since the 2nd of March . And we can see that this is having a huge effect especially on the women and children that are coming into our clinics and hospitals . I see women and children that look they have n't eaten for weeks . And we know that their suffering is increasing because they ca n't find a safe place to sleep at night . And the hospital facilities that are open and providing care are becoming less and less because they 're being targeted . Just the hospital we support in Nassau , it 's been targeted three times in the last few months . And we 've had to close down a lot of our services to try and keep operating with what we can but to also keep people safe as well . It 's becoming impossible . There is a suggestion by the Netanyahu coalition that they are allowing some aid basic levels of aid in at this stage . Are are your teams getting any indication that the aid that is being allowed in by the Netanyahu coalition ? I understand about nine trucks had been allowed in . Partly the UN is now saying it has permission for a hundred more . Are you getting any impression that aid is getting to the people who need it ? This aid that 's coming in has not been seen by any of our teams on the ground and nine trucks is nothing compared to the need here . Even if there are those trucks coming in , we need access to our own aid to come in and we need to be able to use this impartially for the population . We ca n't have it used as a tool of the military objectives and we ca n't have it used just on the contingency that people are forced into areas where they 're not safe and they 're forced into areas then their homes are destroyed behind them . We need full access to this aid and to be able to provide that impartially to the population . they 've been suffering enough now and it 's become a political game .

https://youtu.be/SmB1IcMTG1A?si=5DVpt3qJ259DbNsU,European Union agrees to lift sanctions on Syria to help the war-torn country recover,Al Jazeera English,SmB1IcMTG1A,"going to bring you some breaking news . The European Union 's lifted all sanctions on Syria to help the wartorn country recover following the toppling of the Assad regime in December . Foreign ministers from the block 's 27 member states struck the agreement during a meeting in Brussels . The move follows a similar move by US President Donald Trump to lift sanctions on Syria that was announced in Saudi Arabia last week . Hashim Kabar is joining us live from Brussels . So what are the sanctions that have been lifted ? Hashim Rob , we 're talking about a series of economic sanctions that were imposed by the EU on the former regime in Syria . And these were sanctions that targeted the transport sector , energy and also the banking sector . Back in 2011 2012 , the EU decided to freeze assets of Syrian central bank and also to cancel all Syrian airlines trips into and out of Europe . And they also put more sanctions on the energy sector to deny Bashar al - Assad any access to revenues from the oil exports globally . And this was against the backdrop of the relentless bombardment that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians back then in Syria . What does that mean ? It 's quite a significant development . It 's first of all an acknowledgement that the EU recognizes the authority which is operating now in Syria and that there needs to be now more and more financial transactions to be made to pave the way for the creation of financial stability and improve the living standards of the people in Syria . Let 's expand a little bit on that . , one would imagine , of course , that it is going to have an impact to a degree . We 're talking about transport , energy , and the banking sector , I understand . And do we have any idea what change may happen for people in Syria as a result of this ? Rob , it is really significant for different reasons . First of all , this is also going to be a recognition of the fact that you have to reconnect the Syrian financial and banking system with the global fin banking sector . It is quite a significant development for the Syrians to be able now to wire their own transfers back to Damascus and across the country without fear of any repercussions or sanctions imposed by the by the international community , the EU in particular . It is going to mean also that the assets of the central bank of Syria that were frozen in the European level are going to be now lifted plus the allowing the government to start also exporting oil globally . We 're talking about the potential for more and more revenues to be generated by the Syrian government , but at the same time for the international community to start doing business back with Damascus and provide financial aid because this is not just about the lifting of the sanctions . It is a recognition of the fact that the international community from now onwards is willing to provide significant financial aid to the people in Syria . Thank you very much indeed .

No money means no medicine . If I do n't get medicine , I collapse sometimes , man . I ca n't even walk even to the toilet . I ca n't go to the toilet . My legs all become all weak that . Issa lives in Nairobi 's largest slum in both urban and rural communities . The charity action aid says people are paying the price for years of cuts to public budgets . People living here in Kibra have to pay for any education or health care , including government services . An action aid says public services are in decline across many countries in Africa because of austerity policies and rising national debts . Tens of thousands of people protested in about 50 towns and cities in Kenya last year against a proposal by President William RTO 's government to raise taxes . It 's struggling to service its debt . Dozens were killed in the police crackdown . The government has since continued raising taxes . RT has been widely criticized for doing too much to please Kenya 's creditors and too little for its people . I owe it to the people of Kenya to make the decisions . Sometimes they may not be popular , but they are the decisions that will change the destiny of our country . Our people never defeated . Action aid says cutting services is the wrong decision that Kenya 's government and others should seek debt relief or cancellation instead and the international monetary fund should help the huge debt burdens . Dr. Dabji Atella is someone who 's used to challenging government policy . He leads Kenya 's union for medics including when they march in the streets . He says they 're underpaid , overstretched and many are seeking work abroad . The bigger problem is the corruption cuz when if the money was given as a debt , where did it go ? What did you do ? So you have to strike to get your wages . You have to strike to be promoted . You have to strike to get drugs to treat a patient .

https://youtu.be/HkeeONn5NmI?si=ZJOPhS4cDM3_XRKx,Tens of thousands march in the Netherlands to protest against Gaza genocide,Al Jazeera English,HkeeONn5NmI,"It was the largest protest rally in decades . An estimated 100,000 people took to the street of the H on Sunday to demand the government finally draw a red line against Israel . Families came from all over the country wearing red clothes . I 'm 70 years old . It 's the first demonstration . It 's important enough . A recent survey shows that support for the government 's backing of Israel has from 30 % shortly after October 2023 to only 15 % now . It also shows that 60 % of Dutch people want the government to take a tougher stance on Israel , including those who vote for conservative and -wing parties . Media director Yansla , many here , grew up with the idea that after the Holocaust , support for Israel was a given . Not anymore . The images have made the difference for me . Hearing the word famine is different than seeing how famine looks . If a child looking a skeleton who has no food , no water , nothing , that has really hit me . This is the limit for me . It has to stop and has gone too far already . Cities around the country have now adopted the word genocide to describe Israel 's actions in Gaza . After the mayor of Amsterdam urged the government to act against Israel , the Israeli ambassador in the Netherlands called her a moral failure . . He speaks in name of a regime that is violating human rights in such a scandalous way . Thousands and thousands of children are killed , aid workers , journalists . I do n't think you are in any position then to judge a local administrator in the Netherlands . This change in tone has yet to lead to different policies . Israel and the Netherlands still have an important military relationship and the so - called association treaty for free trade between Israel and the EU despite the Dutch request for a review remains intact . In his book , Echoing History , Sinankaya writes that the Dutch position can be explained because of collective guilt after the Holocaust combined with a colonial ideology . While western leaders murmur never again , colonial racist violence can continue . White superiority thinking has not changed . That 's why I say the west has first revealed itself in colonial times , then in Astitz , and now in Gaza .

I 'm very sad because I see all my things floating in the water . Our TV , refrigerator . We will have to start again , but it 's going to be hard . Almost 10,000 people were evacuated across the province after nearly 300 mm of rain fell over 10 municipalities . The poorest areas were among the most affected . This is the second time this year that entire areas of the province of Buenocidis have been affected with torrential rains and flooding . Most experts say that the main reason of this is climate change . The problem is that authorities here are not ready to cope with changing weather patterns and the impact this has on the population . Rahul Salo is retired and his house was also submerged by the floods . He says the local and provincial governments failed people in the area . I have never seen this . Never . This is incredible . The embankment was not well done . The pumps were not working . People stole the cables . It 's a shame . I have lost it all . The floods happened as Argentina 's President Javier Mille pushes for a roll back on environmental regulations . And just US President Donald Trump continues to express skepticism about climate change . The environment ministry was shut down by the government . The secretariat of climate change remains but it 's very small and those who are there have started to leave . The state 's capacity is very small to carry out the necessary climate commitments related to the Paris agreements .

Dear Kir , what we have agreed today is historic . It will make a real difference to people in the UK and across our union . We are neighbors , allies , partners , and we are friends . As much as the subject matter recalled the bad old days of Brexit negotiations past , the outcome certainly did not . It 's time to look forward . It 's time to move on from the stale old debates and political fights to focus on delivering common sense practical solutions which get the best for the British people . Agreements reached spanned energy , climate , defense , and security . They included lifting red tape on the export of British food and agriculture products to the EU and a pledge to ease cues by allowing British travelers to use e passport gates at EU airports . So Britain back on the world stage said the prime minister and turning the page the start of a new chapter said the leaders of the EU . But will this deal be universally welcomed here in the UK ? Not likely . We 're talking after all about Brexit . Pro - rexit politicians are appalled at concessions made to the EU , including UK alignment with some EU rules on food and farming and a 12 - year extension for EU fishing fleets trolling in UK waters . Some are calling it surrender . There was a reason why people were calling this a surrender deal . Kistan has gone in given away all the concessions and hope that maybe he 'll get something nice in return . This is a sellout of so much of taxpayers money , fishing rights . you this is not going to be a great deal . Both sides rebut suggestions that the clock is being rolled back . Britain is not rejoining the EU . Not even close . This is what good neighbors do , they say , at times of economic and security uncertainty . Lunch on board a warship was symbolic of that . A majority of the public now feels Brexit has n't been a success and the UK government hopes many will view lower food prices in the shops and shorter cues at the airport as an improvement .

https://youtu.be/fZv6XihZC_I?si=kh3sBDBjfAcc29_m,Ukraine's Zelenskyy met with JD Vance at the Vatican to discuss ceasefire progress,Al Jazeera English,fZv6XihZC_I,"US President Donald Trump is due to speak with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia later on Monday . He 's expected to push for an end to the Ukraine war on Sunday . Ukrainian President Vladimir Zalinski met US Vice President JD Vance at the Vatican . It was their first meeting since their dramatic argument at the White House in February . The US and Western powers want a 30 - day unconditional ceasefire to allow for peace negotiations . The first high level talks between the two sides since the start of the war were held in Istanbul last week . Mike Hannah has more from Washington DC . The Trump administration appears to be mounting an allout drive to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine . President Trump will be holding a series of phone calls over the coming 24 hours . He 'll be speaking to both the Ukrainian and the Russian presidents as well as European leaders . this . His special envoy to the region , Steve Woodoff , had this to say . We have to get to a ceasefire . That 's the that 's the president 's position , and we all agree with that position . And most importantly , we have to get to a final peace deal . And the president has a force of personality that is unmatched . I think it 's important his sensibilities are that he 's got to get on the phone with President Putin and that is going to clear up some of the log jam and get us to the place that we need to get to and I think it 's going to be a very successful call . The vice president JD Vance has been having a series of meetings in Italy . He 's met the Ukrainian president as well as European leaders once again lending support to the concept that there is a massive Trump administration thrust underway to get that elusive ceasefire in place . Mike Hannah Alazer Washington . Let 's get the latest from John Hendrend who 's in the Ukrainian capital Kiev . John , so firstly , , the last time JD Vance and Zilinsky met , , it was n't exactly plain sailing , was it ? , any reaction to this brief meeting at the Vatican ? [ Applause ] , . it here it 's a beautiful day in overlooking Maidan Square in Kev . But whether it 's a productive day for Ukrainians or for that matter for people in Washington depends in large part on that phone call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time with Donald Trump . That 's 200 p.m. GMT and it 's about 5:00 here in Kev . And after that call , we may know more . But Trump seems to be setting high expectations for that call . He says his goal in that call is to stop the bloodbath that he says is killing 5,000 Ukrainian and Russian troops each week . He says , among other things , that he and Vladimir Putin will talk trade . He said after that call is over , as you heard Mike Hannah say in that story just a moment ago , then he will talk to Vimir Zalinsky of Ukraine and with NATO leaders . the order of that is less than optimal in from the Ukrainian perspective because it suggests that Trump will be relating Russian talking points and of course Zilinski wants to be in on those discussions . Trump somewhat undermined Zalinski when he said nothing recently that nothing really big is going to happen in these negotiations until he has a face - to - face meeting with Vladimir Putin . That would seem to cut Zalinsky and the Ukrainians out and give them a secondary role . Something Zalinski very much does not want to happen . And you can bet he will be pressing those points in his conversation with Trump after Trump talks to Putin . But Trump says that he 's hoping the call will lead to a ceasefire and ultimately an end to the war . John , I wonder if we can reflect on what may or may not have come out of Istanbul talks . Obviously , Vladimir Putin was n't there . Zilinski Zalinski was the Russians sent a high level delegation now that the Ukrainians have had the weekend to digest what happened there in Istanbul . Any sentiment , any attitude as to what happened there ? , absolutely . Zalinsky has reacted to last week 's talks in Istanbul which he said were very disappointing and he talked about that in a meeting with JD Vance the US vice president and with Secretary of State Marco Rubio . He did that in Rome at the installation on Sunday of Pope Leo I 14th . And he said that was a good meeting . That was a contrast of course as you mentioned earlier to that meeting in which Vance publicly along with Trump bered Zalinski in front of cameras in front of the pool and in front of the world saying among other things have you ever said thank you to the American people . but in this case , Zilinsky on social media said it was not only a good meeting , but that they discussed that Istanbul meeting last week , which he said was disappointing because it was low - level officials who had no power to negotiate anything . Of course , Zalinsky had demanded along with European leaders a ceasefire for 30 days before that meeting happened . and that did n't happen and we did n't hear vocal support for that position from Donald Trump . so that again seemed to undermine Zalinsk 's position but he said that he Vance and Rubio talked about the importance of a ceasefire about sanctions on Russia and the importance of continuing that pressure to bring them to the table . He said they also talked about bilateral trade end the situation on the battlefield . But what he really wants is for the US to press for more sanctions and to press for a ceasefire that will ultimately end the war . And he did say that he thanked Americans . something JD Vance had urged him to do previously and of course something he has done many times . All , John . Many thanks John Hendren there in Kiev .

To call yourself a poor man , I think is a luxury in Nigeria today . All we want is to survive . The country is one of the world 's leading producers of oil . Analysts say decades of corruption and bad economic policies have wiped out the country 's once thriving middle class . And more bad news is expected . The World Bank has warned that more Nigerians will be poor in the next 5 years . The institution says economic weaknesses and Nigeria 's dependence on oil revenues are partly to blame . But a decade of violence in rural communities has also crippled agriculture and commerce . The industrial sector struggles to produce . When it does , goods are too expensive , partly because energy and transportation costs have more than tripled over the last decade . One solution is better education . At this skill center in the northern state of Saquatu , dozens of women are taught traits . Many of them did n't go to school . Officials say targeting of women and girls is deliberate . Most of our women , they are not educated . They supposed to be empowered so that they will use this money and invest their family . Others say Nigeria should focus on scaling up agriculture in a country where most farmers barely scrape by . Invest heavily on agriculture . That will have multiple posive effects . One , you have food security . Two , you have employment across all over . But food security also requires physical security .

He says he stayed to protect his property from being stolen as the RSF took over his neighborhood of Buri . The RSF came to our house and threatened us . They made us all sit in the middle of the living room and stayed for about 3 hours . They turned the house upside down and took everything they deemed valuable , even the food . They came several times at different times of the day and threatened us with killing the kids to take what they want . Usama said he filed a report with police . It was one of thousands of home robberies reported by residents of the capital , all accusing the RSF , according to authorities . But those who stayed here say the robberies go beyond just homes . Shops and businesses have also been broken into . Power cables have been dug up and stolen for their copper . And cars that were left behind by their owners were taken by fighters of the paramilitary . This hospital was once one of the largest in Kum . It was taken over by the RSF during the first months of the conflict and forced to halt its operations . The hospital lost so much of its surgical equipments and the lab was also robbed . This was not random work . This was systematic . The work of someone who knows how to remove medical equipments from their places . We now lack any machine we need to operate . And it 's not the only hospital to go out of service during the conflict . Nearly all hospitals located in areas that were controlled by the paramilitary have been looted . Medical equipment has been stolen and warehouses that held medical supplies worth hundreds of thousands of dollars have been left bare . But the looting and pillaging of Hartum does not end here . The Bank of Hartum is one of Sudan 's largest banks and once had more than 50 branches in the capital . Now only five are operational . more than 95 % of our branches in Kartum were broken into and destroyed including our headquarters . We had large amounts of currency stolen from those branches . We also had safety deposit boxes where people stored their valuables in including jewelry that too has been looted . Hartum State Police say despite the more than 25,000 cases of robbery and looting reported , many others have gone unreported . Kartum is now mostly under the army 's control . But for the thousands who 've lost their belongings , the retaking of the capital does n't mean the return of what was taken from them . Heorgan Alazer Kum .

https://youtu.be/LuxZMeexo4M?si=Vj0MhhT_G2rOrZ4U,China releases new economic data under the cloud of US tariffs,Al Jazeera English,LuxZMeexo4M,"Investment in China 's property market fell by nearly 10 % in the first four months of 2025 compared to the same period last year . That 's according to official data . It comes in the wake of renewed trade tensions with the United States . But despite a minor drop in April retail sales , the economy showed resilience with manufacturing beating expectations . Beijing has been seeking to boost domestic consumption to offset expected drops in exports . The US and China announced a 90 - day pause in their tariff war last week following talks in Geneva . Katrina U breaks down the numbers from Beijing . China 's economy is so far showing itself to be resilient in the face of unpredictable US tariffs . In March , the Trump administration imposed a 145 % tariff on all Chinese goods going into the US . Despite this , China 's industrial output for the month of April expanded faster than expected . It rose by 6.1 % beating expectations of about 5.7 % . Retail sales however a key indicator for domestic consumption missed its forecast . It rose by 5.1 % compared to 5.9 % the previous month . China 's property sector also remains in a stubborn slump across 70 cities . New home prices fell by 0.12 % compared to the previous month . Now , earlier this month , , Beijing and Washington agreed to a 90 - day trade war truce , slashing those previous reciprocal tariffs . All Chinese goods going to the US are now charged 30 % and US goods coming here are levied at 10 % , down from 125 % . Because of this , many investment banks have now raised China 's growth forecast for this year . However , many people here still remain reluctant to spend and cautious . And we know this because bank time deposits reached a all - time high for the month of April . Katrina Alazer Beijing . Andy Mark is a senior research fellow with the Center for China and Globalization . That 's a think tank based in Beijing . He 's joining us from Hong Kong . Thank you very much for your time , Andy . Good to see you . So , let 's break down the numbers even more . Perhap we can perhaps we can start with the good news . Industrial output grew 6.1 % yearonear in April and that is stronger than analysts expectations for a 5.5 % rise . What do you put that down to ? , thanks for having me on today , Elizabeth . So , I think this particular number demonstrates two things . So one is the fundamental structural resilience of the Chinese economy and a large part of that comes from an almost decadel long effort to prepare the country and the economy to harden it against exactly the vicissitudes that we are witnessing that happened in April of this year with Trump 's unleashing of this barrage of tariffs . So I think that 's one thing we can see . I think the other is that we 're really it 's it 's very noisy data . I think if we look at this particular set of data that was just released , there were no unpleasant surprises . there were a couple numbers the one you just mentioned that were that exceeded expectations . There were some that did not meet expectations . But I think it 's important to look at the bigger picture here which is that I think China 's economic fundamentals are strong and it has demonstrated a tremendous amount of resilience and certainly China is the biggest trading partner for something a 100 countries but it will the US tariffs will of course have an impact . Retail sales rose 5.1 % in April and that missed analysts estimates of 5.5 % growth . China wants domestic consumption to grow , but how much of a challenge is that going to be ? , I think there 's two issues here , Elizabeth . So , one is clearly cyclical . consumer sentiment has absolutely taken a hit in China . So , the residential real estate market is one important factor . It 's a vital store of wealth for many Chinese families . the trade war of course has had a knock - on effect . So , I think this is one factor . there are structural issues as well . So , China of course has relied on export growth , infrastructure investment to power the economic development over decades that have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty . And I think it 's recognized by the government that this does need to transition at a structural level so that there is greater sustainable consumption in the Chinese economy . But I want to briefly say though that despite all this China 's export performance in the last 5 years has gone from I think 2.6 trillion in exports to about 3.53 3.6 trillion in 2024 . So it 's an increase of more than 30 % despite these very challenging conditions . So consumption is very important but I think at the same time it 's easy to get lost in the noise that we see with monthly data releases , quarterly data releases . But if we zoom out even just a little bit , I think we see that there are some powerful secular trends that will be difficult for the US to overcome as it seeks to achieve whatever its objectives are visa v China .

This is an industry that lost plentiful cheap EU workers while raw material costs shot up by a fifth thanks to Brexit trade barriers and an end to free movement of people . I do n't know really why I voted Brexit now because there 's there 's not been much benefit . It 's just been a lot of hardship really and a lot of trade problems with the EU and then there 's obviously the travel issues that are happening now as well . Many in the industry thought Brexit would give Britain a building boost but now say the failure of government to reform planning rules and invest in skills training has led to critical gaps especially for small to medium - sized businesses this one . If you and your neighbor had a bit of a issue over your wheelie bins or something one day and then you never talked after that , you 're always going to have that tension . It 's a similar thing . It 's that stifled relationship where it should have been , , we not happy with the current arrangement . Fine , let 's put that to one side . What 's the new thing ? It 's it 's always breaking something down without putting something better in its place . And the building trade is by no means alone with Brexit expected to shrink the UK 's economy long - term by 4 % worth $ 130 billion . New trade deals with India and the United States may help . But for the government , negotiating with the EU risks losing electoral ground , especially to the anti - immigration reform party . We have to try and find a new agreement with our largest trading partner . But for Kier Starmer who sits in the center ground , he 's trying to reach out to disaffected Labor voters who are going reform , for example . He 's got to reach out to the left wing of his party , to the progressive wing of his party . This is a very difficult path to follow because he 's not going to go far enough for one group and he 's going to go far too far for another . The British government says it wants to move on from the battles of the past , its words , over Brexit . That it simply wants a better deal with the EU that will bring greater economic and security benefits . The problem is the EU is demanding a price and that price risks igniting old battles all over again . Concessions under discussion include greater access to UK fishing waters , cheaper fees for EU students at UK universities and a limited return to youth mobility . And already opposition politicians are sounding the alarm , accusing the government of Brexit betrayal . Jonah Alazer in the West Midlands .

As the results came in , the crowd cheered , partly out of relief , but mostly in joy . I truly supported Nikicoan because I believed that he could fix the problems . Democracy won today . we are free . The far candidate I believe is a real threat to our rights as women , as minorities . So , it 's really comforting to know that maybe he will not be president . It 's is the I think it 's one of the best days of my life . This was supposed to be a tight race , but for the supporters of Niku Shaan , it 's turned out better than expected . And for them , it 's not just about Romania itself , but it 's also about Romania 's place within the European Union . Yet a note of caution from the winner as he spoke to Al Jazer of the task that lies ahead . The tension in the society in my opinion will remain until the older Romanian will begin to believe that the Romanian data is working for them . His rival George Simeon had claimed victory during the vote count but was forced to concede defeat on his social media account as his share of the vote decreased . We lost the second round of the elections here . I had over 5 million votes . My counter candidate won with an extra 1 million votes . Simeon 's route to power was backed by Kalin Gescu , the hardright nationalist candidate who won the election in November last year , which was then cancelled over allegations of Russian interference . But in the end , Simeon 's vision for Romania was rejected by the majority of voters who chose a reformist instead of a disruptor and a reassurance also for a European Union seeking some restbite from the turbulence of populist politics .

Despite help from Russian mercenaries and government militia known as the Voluntary for the Defense of the Homeland or VDPs , Bkina 's forces have lost control of half of their country , equivalent to the size of France . Al - Qaeda is gaining ground , launching coordinated attacks across the Sahel and pushing towards the coastlines . Their message is Panaffrican 2 targeting regimes they call corrupt and unable to unite an ethnically diverse region . In March , Human Rights Watch accused the army in Bkina Faso of deliberately targeting ethnic fanis . The targeting of civilians of fani civilians is part of a widespread campaign of violence against them condoned at the highest level of the government and can perhaps also constitute government policy . On Thursday , an al - Qaeda affiliate overran the northern town of Jibo , killing around 200 soldiers and taking down the flag of Bkina Faso and of Russia .

https://youtu.be/rrU0RQa3AoM?si=QMGZJPupPlgKdNZK,Ukraine comes under Russia's largest drone attack since the war began,Al Jazeera English,rrU0RQa3AoM,"Ukraine says Russia has launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine since the start of the war . Ukraine 's air force says it managed to down 88 of the 273 drones which targeted Kev , Denipro , Petrovsk and Detsk . At least one woman has been killed in the attack . Three others were injured . Several towns have suffered damage . US President Donald Trump says he plans to speak to both the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on Monday in an effort to bring an end to what he called the bloodbath of the war on Ukraine . Mike Hannah has more details from Washington DC . Certainly , it does seem that President Trump wants to kickstart the processes . He 's making very clear in the social media message that he 's going to be speaking to Putin , but more than that , he is then going to be speaking to Vir Zalinski and then leaders of NATO . So , he is creating into this day , it would appear , a series of discussions aimed at ending this ongoing conflict . Now , interestingly enough , President Mccron has made reference to this in the course of the day where he 's meeting in Tran and Albania saying that NATO leaders and France itself are behind President Trump and the plan that the US has drawn up . So , making very clear as well that the US is central to the process to get a ceasefire in place . President Trump has gone backwards and forwards in terms of who 's his favorite in this ongoing conflict . He was very favorable towards Putin . Initially he was very critical of Zilinski . but recently this has changed and he 's been critical of Putin and most importantly he 's put his full support behind NATO as well as behind Ukraine in terms of securing that ceasefire . That has been a movement by Donald Trump in terms of where the bulk of his support is going . so significant that on Monday he will be holding these series of conversations aimed at getting that ceasefire . , let 's bring in our correspondent Zay Basrai . He 's joining us live from the Ukrainian capital . Zayn , we 're hearing that the air raid sirens in Kev sounded for more than 9 hours . Tell us about this largecale drone attack . That is correct . It was another sleepless night for the residents of Kev . Air raid alarm started going off at around 3:00 or 4 in the morning in the early hours of the morning and went on well into this morning for as you say nearly 9 hours . It was one of the longest durations of these air raid alarms that we 've seen and underground subway stations have started to fill up with people seeking safety once again . These were mainstays of the early days of the war and we 've seen those features return to Kev and other parts of the country in recent weeks . Now in Kev there was an attack that damaged again a civilian infrastructure and apartment building . Elsewhere as you said a woman in Obuk district of the Kev region was killed , three other injured there . And we 're seeing these drone strikes continue to happen over and over again . More than 270 drones were used . Ukraine 's air force said it shot down 88 . There were some other decoys , but the fact of the matter is that this drone strike overnight into this morning was more than the double more than double the average amount of drones Russia has used on nearly a nightly basis since the beginning of this year . And Zayn , what 's been the reaction there to President Trump saying that he 'll speak to both Presidents Putin and Zilinski on Monday ? , let me read to you some interesting posts from the Institute for the Study of War in the last day or so . They 've said that what they are seeing is that Russia is preparing for a large - scale offensive in the Kharkiv region across the border from Ukraine , across the border from the city of Kharkiv . We 've also gotten a note from them . They put out a post saying that everything they 've seen play out in the last week , all of the diplomacy , all of it seems to illustrate that according to their assessment , Russia 's war aim remains the full Ukrainian capitulation . So what we have seen in the past weeks has been all about diplomacy , all about trying to negotiate a peaceful settlement . What we are likely to see in coming days , the conversations between Trump and Zalinski and Ukraine 's European allies , is to illustrate to the White House that they have tried the path to peace . Now they need to take practical steps to prepare for more war . Russia has been massing troops all along the border in various areas of the front line according to Ukraine 's military . And Ukrainian leaders are likely going to be pressing Trump to say that we have illustrated our willingness for peace , but Russia has not come to the table as an honest broker . it is now time to give us the tools we need to carry on the war . Estimates by Ukraine 's military generals in past months has been that they have the capacity and likely will have to carry on the war for between the next 2 to four years .

The protest marks the 77th anniversary of what Palestinians referred to as the Nagba , the Arabic word for catastrophe . The Nagba resulted in the permanent mass displacement of people after the creation of Israel in 1948 . Activists say history is repeating itself in Gaza and the occupied West Bank with tens of thousands of Palestinians being forced from their homes . Vanovich is at the rally in London . , people here have come from all over the country and they 're marching through central London as they have done for the past 18 months calling for a ceasefire . There 's a lot of anger among people here because they say that despite the very high death toll of civilians in Gaza despite the fact that Israel is withholding aid into Gaza , what they 've heard from the UK government so far are only words of condemnation and not action . Take a listen to what some of the people that we spoke to told us . I want a ceasefire now . I want end of occupation now . I want this government to listen to the people to stop arming Israel . We ca n't be silent . We must do something now . So , because these people have got nothing . They 've got no food . and they 're being bombed to death day after day . So , we have to stand up and tell our government to stop supporting them . start helping these people who are just abandoned . It 's really amazing to see a lot of a collective of people around doing things that are angry that all these organizations . That was making me really tearful to see the amount of support there is and this outpouring of anger and love at the same time . We do n't come out and nobody comes out . Nobody 's they 're all going to get away with whatever they can get away with . Just by doing this , we 're making a bit of a statement , a little bit of a pebble in the ocean of everything that 's happening . So , I 'd rather be that little pebble than do nothing . Now , the UK has suspended some arms export licenses to Israel , but not all of them . And for many people here , that means that they believe that the UK is complicit in some of the actions of the Israeli state .

The ship is an oldstyle threemasted sailing vessel . It reportedly carries a crew of more than 270 people . Video of the incident shows the ship drifting backwards with its mast failing to clear the bridge . A search and rescue operation has been launched to pull people out of the water . , Alazer 's Gabriel Lzando joins us on the phone now from New York . Gabe , so what more details are now emerging about this ship hitting the Brooklyn Bridge ? Just within the last couple minutes , the New York Fire Department and Police Department as well as the mayor held a press briefing . It just ended within the last minute or two . So I have a little bit of new information . As you stated , 19 injured , four seriously . however , they are now saying that they do not believe anybody fell into the East River . So they are no longer searching for any people that are missing . They think everyone is accounted for . They also said that this Navy ship is a Goodwill vessel that was on its way from Cancun , Mexico on its way to Iceland as part of a world tour when it stopped here in New York City . they say initially it appears that the ship had some mechanical failure according to initial reports from the press briefing from the New York authorities here . But they said that the National Transportation Safety Board will be taking over the investigation . Clearly this could have been much worse . but as of now clearly some really incredible images on social media because there were thousands of people in Brooklyn and on the Manhattan side of the East River all taking video of this huge sailing ship as it was going near the Brooklyn Bridge and as it crashed into the bridge . It appeared that the huge ship was going backwards . That 's why authorities initially think there was some mechanical failure . , Gabe . And as , the Brooklyn Bridge is a big tourist spot , is n't it ? And the East River is of course a busy waterway . So , what impact is this incident likely to have on the area ? The Brooklyn Bridge was closed for about 30 minutes . It has just reopened . that is cing causing huge traffic delays . However , officials closed the bridge so they can could ascertain if there was any structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge . they were able to determine that there is none . So , they have reopened it . Nevertheless , the ship now is stuck , if you will , under the Manhattan Bridge , another one of the three major bridges on the East River . fire department now trying to figure out how to maneuver it into some safety . There 's clearly going to be a blockage of that area . the Brooklyn Bridge is open . This clearly could have been much worse . If there would have been structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge , we would be talking about a much different situation now . So , I think the sense that we got from the New York authorities was a little bit of a sigh of relief that this could have been much worse . However , they still have a big task at hand trying to figure out how to get this massive ship out of the East River to open up the waterways around where it is stuck now . All , Alazer 's Gabe Lezando live for us there on the phone from New York . Gabe , thank you . Make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Algera ."

https://youtu.be/Quj63FLjmpw?si=Pxx5zNtdR2nrYrXE,Romania braces for tight presidential runoff between far-right and centrist candidates,Al Jazeera English,Quj63FLjmpw,"Some 80 kilometers north of Bucharest lies the city of Targovishe , a longtime stronghold of the left - leaning social democrats , the largest party in Romania . But in recent times , there has been a quiet shift . In the wake of communism , Romania embraced its future within the European Union . But over the years , corruption , a stagnant economy , and a lack of opportunities for younger people have left a growing sense of unease and political apathy . And the effect is felt everywhere in the city . Business owner Tibio Nitsa has seen how people here have become disillusioned . I think people feel most voting for change because they 've lost faith in the current political class . The level of corruption people witness is very high and there 's no sense of connection with the authorities anymore . This is the choice voters face . In one corner , ultra - ist provocator George Simeon importing a Donald Trump style narrative designed to shake up the system . He faces Nikushdan , the mayor of Bucharest , a reformist pro- European Union . Politically , he represents the opposite of Simeon , more concerned with preserving the system rather than tearing it down . This election is being pitched as a battle between nationalist populism and a centrist establishment . But the reality is that Romania , a NATO member , shares a border with war torn Ukraine , the longest of any country within the European Union . And that also makes it one of the most vulnerable within the block . Across the Danube River in the east , a reminder that conflict is never far away . where fragments of Russian drones that have violated Romanian airspace have been discovered . Yet , it has not stopped support for Vladimir Putin from Simeon 's political ally , Khalind Jesu , the now banned candidate who emerged as the shock winner of last November 's election . His use of social media galvanized a wave of support , in particular , from younger voters . And while the results were cancelled after allegations of Russian interference , Joesco 's presence looms over this election . So we have to look at what is happening online and there we have seen a lot of misinformation . We have seen a lot of inauthentic behavior and coordinated inauthentic behavior . We 've seen allegations of foreign interference in our elections . It may come down to Romania 's diaspora , the fifth largest in the world , and their concerns may very well shape the course their country takes . Sonia Ggo , Alazer , Bucharest .

They met two months ago in Cairo . Then , now , Israel 's war on Gaza dominated discussions . Except this gathering coincides with a new major military offensive Israel launched against Gaza . Speaker after speaker , the warning was the same . Palestinians are facing an existential threat . We have n't continued to reject the forced displacement of Palestinians while it is necessary to stop the massacres in Gaza . Leaders here sought to highlight the reality . Gaza , they said , is under siege , its people hungry , and they appealed to Israel 's closest ally , the United States , for help . I call on President Trump as a man who champions peace to do what is necessary and exert pressure to bring a ceasefire in Gaza and allow for a serious peace process to start . US President Donald Trump was in the region this week . Many had hoped there would be a deal on a ceasefire in Gaza . Instead , Trump is still talking about his desire to take over Gaza and depopulate the enclave , a proposal the Arab League dismissed . Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas went as far as to present a roadmap for post - war governance in Gaza that would involve Hamas handing over its arms to the Palestinian Authority . A suggestion Hamas immediately rejected . Gaza may have taken center stage , but this year 's summit was held against a backdrop of a new Middle East order . There 's a new balance of power which is not in the favor of Iran and its regional allies . And that is why a few days ago , Iran tried to project its influence in Iraq with a rare public visit by the head of the Elkud 's force , Ismael Kani . Also , powerful Iraqi politicians opposed Prime Minister Sudani 's invitation to the new Syrian leader , Ahmed Al Shara , due to his past links with al - Qaeda . Iraqi groups supported the ousted Syrian leader , Bashar al - Assad . The new Syria was represented by its foreign minister who made clear the country is no longer in the Iranian - led axis . The Syrian people are holding on to their Arab identity . The new Syria has extended its hand to all . Syrians paid a heavy price due to the policies of the ousted regime . An Arab world that appears to have little impact or lack a unified stance and the political will to end a devastating war on the Palestinian people . Zenor Alazer Baghdad .

https://youtu.be/6CRceKhudDg?si=BBnZcI7bFuOe_auF,Trump lying about wanting regional peace: Khamenei,Al Jazeera English,6CRceKhudDg,"Iran Supreme Leader has accused US President Donald Trump of lying when he said he wanted peace in the region . Donald Trump just wrapped up a tour of Gulf nations . A day ago , Trump said the US had sent a proposal on Iran 's nuclear program , but Thran denied receiving it . Ali said that Trump can not be trusted . He said that he wanted to use power for peace . He lied . Some of the statements made during the US president 's visit to the region are not worthy of a response at all . This is a failed pattern and with the efforts of the nations of the region , America must and will leave this region . The Zionist regime which is a dangerous , deadly , cancerous tumor in this region must and will be uprooted . Let 's speak now with Assad who 's live for us in Thran . and to hear the Supreme Leader wholly condemning Donald Trump 's position . , part of the statements that we heard today from Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Ky is response to the recent statements that we had from President Trump during his visit to the region . we heard at least two important lines of criticism . one of them directed towards the United States for supporting war provoking war wherever it can and use of force for massacre specifically with a reference to Gaza and supporting mercenaries in order to further destabilize the region . And there was another line of criticism that was directed in a indirect way indeed to regional countries saying that there is a fundamental dependence to the United States and Americans are following these pattern to keep and to maintain this level of in dependency of regional countries to the United States . All in all , I can say that if you look at the statements , at least it 's important from three four perspectives . First , in terms of timing , we know that the statements are coming out while Iran is get getting ready for a next round of indirect talks between Washington and Thran to deal with the nuclear program of the country in return for lifting of the sanctions . Secondly , it 's important from a from a perspective of military posture . Iranian supreme leader said that the country should maintain the level of its preparedness and the very nature of power that Iran is using according to him to secure peace and stability in the region quite contradictory to what we heard from Trump who claims that the US force in the region is the source of peace and stability . Also there is this political sphere from which we can take a look at this statements . He is the supreme leader indeed is putting emphasis upon the necessity of independence and let 's say securing the sovereignty of the country under this current situation . We heard some harsh criticisms from the Iranian supreme leaders specifically when it came to the Israelis behavior in the region . That 's what we have generally speaking about the latest statements that we heard from Ali K Iranian Supreme Leader . Thanks for that there in Thran ."

I could n't be more pleased to announce that as of today , the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule . Kennedy , a noted vaccine skeptic , has questioned whether the CO 19 vaccine was successful in saving millions of lives . Today , he was joined by other top health officials . There 's no evidence healthy kids need it today , and most countries have stopped recommending it for children . But the move was quickly questioned by public health officials accusing the Trump administration of bypassing the traditional independent review process , including recommendations from medical experts . We were blindsided by this announcement . We were not consulted about this , Dr. Shaun Olri with the American Academy of Pediatrics said , and the leading OBGYn association with this dire warning .

https://youtu.be/r5rsyqIS98c?si=-4lDSYAY-xRLeEJR,New Gaza aid distribution operation draws concerns from humanitarian groups,abc news,r5rsyqIS98c,"Also , chaos and desperation erupting in Gaza as a US - backed group says it has begun aid distribution in the territory following Israel 's nearly threemonth blockade of supplies . There 's video circulating online and it shows the moment that thousands of Palestinians flooded this distribution center in Rafa . Now , the new system is drawing some concerns from humanitarian groups , including the United Nations , saying the mechanism violates humanitarian rights and enables Israel to use food as a weapon . Mara Croninfeld is the executive director of Enroy USA . That is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees . Thank you for joining us . A a lot to get to . Now the UN has expressed concern over the things I just mentioned as well as the idea here that the UN can not distribute aid independently in this new system . Tell me more about that . , the UN is completely out of this system . and what we witnessed today was an avoidable travesty . We saw thousands of desperate , hungry Palestinians , you mentioned , who have n't received food aid in 80 days trying to get food for their family . What what the footage did n't show was that these thousands of people were in camps essentially waiting and then when they tried to get food shots were fired as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation , so - called foundation was trying to control the crowd . this is not how aid should be delivered . If the United Nations was involved , as it was and as it has been for seven decades , aid would be given with transparency , safely , independently , and with the dignity of the recipients involved . This was a travesty . The IDF did say that they fired warning shots , but not in the direction of the people . the IDF also claiming today on social media that they have some 400 trucks that are waiting in Gaza they say to be distributed by the UN . what is your response to that ? Is that true ? If so , what 's the backlog ? That would be new because they have outlawed the UN 's engagement in the distribution of aid . In fact , Anora has I hope it 's true . I hope something 's changed . Honora has 12,000 employees on the ground who are ready to distribute aid . And frankly , 400 trucks is a drop in an ocean of need . Anora was able to bring in some 500 to 600 trucks . UNWA and its partners , which is what 's needed on a daily basis for the food and other emergency needs of this population . UNWA itself has six 6,000 trucks waiting to get in now . Again , 400 is nothing . with the UN partners , we have enough food aid to feed a population of 1 million for four weeks . This aid has to be let in . It 's sitting outside of Gaza . And meanwhile , we have the travesty that we saw today , which is completely avoidable if the people with experience in humanitarian aid are the ones providing it . Meanwhile , the whole population of Gaza is facing starvation with one in five people on the verge of a man - made famine . I want to ask you about the location of some of these aid hubs that they 've put in place . Three of the four planned are in southern Gaza . There 's another one in the middle . , in your opinion , does that strategy perhaps help feed people as well as eliminate Hamas ? . In fact , , the opposite . That strategy , as , defense minister of Israel , Smootrich , himself said , that strategy is to force the population of Gaza closer to the southern border . And as he said himself , as he said the quiet part out loud , and then force them into Egypt . That strategy is explicitly about population displacement , ethnic cleansing , about what the government in Israel has said out loud , which is removing the Palestinian people , the people of Gaza from the Gaza Strip . That is really what 's behind the taking over of the food aid . 400 trucks will get you nowhere . And there 's been no discussion in this whole and everything we 've heard about shelter , about medicine , about how other aid will get in . , this is really a sad attempt at really hiding what the true purpose is of this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is . You spoke about other aid items medicine . Any idea if fuel is getting in I it 's not just about operating a motor vehicle or something that . This is about getting these desalinization plants up and running again . Do we have any information there ? , 100 % . It 's hospitals . the electricity has been cut off from the Gaza Strip for many months as you said everything desalination hospitals anything that runs on electricity is done through a generator which requires fuel . I myself have not heard that fuel 's gotten in . And every time you talk about trucks , there 's a number of trucks who got into the border , but the secretary general of the UN himself said that as of a couple days ago , some 400 trucks got through the border , but only 100 of those trucks were able to unload their supplies into warehouses . And very few Palestinians , talking 2 million Palestinians , very few a very small amount , have been able to get aid at this point . . A dire situation . I hope that you 'll keep us updated . Mara Croninfeld , thank you for being on with us today . Absolutely . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/_5iDeqjC8dc?si=qXC4_ufAnqirQtN9,White House directing federal agencies to review contracts with Harvard University,abc news ,_5iDeqjC8dc,"So , Crimson Clash . President Trump escalating his fight now against Harvard University . A senior administration official telling us that the White House is directing federal agencies to identify any contracts with Harvard University and review whether they can be cancelled or redirected elsewhere . Trump even suggesting over the weekend he might take away $ 3 billion from Harvard and reallocate it all that money to trade schools . All this comes as a judge could decide this week whether to extend an order that bars the Trump administration from revoking Harvard 's ability to enroll international students . All part of the war on Harvard . Let 's bring in ABC News senior reporter Katherine Fers . So , Katherine , can the White House redirect this money ? The president has a lot of executive authority over money , but the Congress does as well . Can he do it ? And how is Harvard responding ? , that 's . He he does and this is sure to be caught up in the courts Terry as you mentioned that hearing later in the week on a separate but related issue the war on Harvard if you will . So the question also really is whether the administration should be doing this . This is n't talking about funding over the school soccer team if you will . This is in billions of dollars that is very valuable research to the federal government in theory . This is u congressionally appropriated money as you mentioned . This is also money that comes out of the budget from NIH , for example , for science related research , for veterans related research , a number of things that this goes to research- wise that is useful to the federal government . Now , of course , Trump and the administration are saying that Harvard is anti - Semitic . Harvard is denying all of that and responding in various different statements . But it does come of course as that judge last week essentially issued that ruling which now there will be a hearing Thursday over whether the Trump administration can continue to bar the administration from revoking these ability to enroll international students at Harvard . Remember this is only a temporary pause . As you note , there will be a hearing later in the week to see if that should be extended for longer . But all of this goes together behind the scenes . I know that this is at the forefront of every agency 's mind and the White House in terms of how they move forward here litigation wise , what arguments they make in court before this judge on Thursday . And again , this battle over the funding , how exactly will that work ? Trump saying that he 's going to redirect this funding to trade schools . The administration has n't said how they will do that . That is also a topic of discussion behind the scenes because it does n't seem there 's a real plan at this point ."
https://youtu.be/uXu8ZZe13F8?si=VERte7EkwrBANvT0,Negotiations continue to free wrongly-detained Americans,abc news,uXu8ZZe13F8,", from Gaza to Kuwait , from Caracus to the Kremlin , every American being held hostage abroad wants Adam Bowler on their side . The US hostage envoy negotiated with Hamas to release Idan Alexander . He helped free a ballerina from a Moscow prison . And now his focus is on Venezuela . At least eight Americans are currently being unjustly detained in Venezuelan prisons . a State Department spokesperson saying all Americans unjustly detained by the Maduro regime must be released immediately . The United States continues our efforts to secure the release of any remaining Americans . Joining me now , President Trump 's special envoy for hostage response , Adam Buller . Adam , good to see you again . Before we get to your work in Venezuela , you met last night , I know , with the families of the remaining hostages held in Gaza . You told them that you hope for a development in the next two days . Can you give us any details ? I think we 're always working hard on this issue . Steve Witoff 's working hard . The president himself is working hard along with Marco Rubio also . So you have an a team focused on it . And here 's what we know . The president wants the situation over . He wants hostages home . and so I ca n't specify exact time . It 's always hard to know . but we 're working hard on it . All . I know news will come shortly . , you became the first US official to directly negotiate with Hamas . Not only did you have talks with this terrorist organization , but your team went around Prime Minister Net Netanyahu . Why do you feel this was the way to carry out this mission in order to get things done ? I do want to emphasize that my job working for the United States is to meet with bad guys . , at the end of the day , people that take hostages are not good , normal people . , and Hamas is not a good group , obviously . , and so our job is to try to get them back . It 's what I do . It 's my official position . , so nothing negative on the administration in Israel or anywhere . They 're a key ally . But I am charged in any case to get every single American home by the president of the United States , and I will do everything I can to do that . , you definitely made that clear through the channels that you did use and you now face tough negotiations with Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro . First of all , how 's that going now ? I think Maduro has released a few Americans or I do n't think he has . he 's released to Rick Grenell . we 've seen photos some great photos of Americans coming home . that should continue . It needs to continue . every country in the world needs to know . You can have no relationship with the United States if you are holding US citizens . And so you 're correct in exactly what you said . We have a number of US citizens still in Venezuela and two things need to happen . One , they all need to come home . And number two , it has to be very clear that Venezuelan American citizens ca n't be taken any again . I 'm curious , what 's been more difficult , dealing with Hamas or Maduro ? these are impossible comparisons to make one way or the other . They both have Americans . I do n't that in either situation . but very difficult comparisons . That 's apples and oranges for sure . That 's what we figured . I had to ask the question though . We always want to somehow get on the inside , Adam . what rights do these unjustly detained individuals have under international law now ? , they 're unjustly held and so the rights are that they should be released immediately and I want Americans to know a couple things here . Number one , do n't go to Venezuela . because now there 's a lot of Americans in Venezuela . It 's not a safe place and they 'll take you . and it 's not criminals they 're taking to be clear . do n't think about it wo n't happen to you because it will happen . A lot of the people they 're taking are not criminals . They 're only American . The second thing my job is to make sure that people understand being a citizen of the United States is a benefit . The president has made very clear we will come for you but we need you not to get yourself there in this situation . Adam Bowler , great to have you today . Appreciate your time . Thank you ."

The driver is being held on suspicion of attempted murder and other charges . The incident is not being treated as terrorism . King Charles issued a statement saying that he and the queen are deeply shocked and saddened . They offered their prayers and deepest sympathy . ABC News chief foreign correspondent Ian Panel is on the scene in Liverpool . , Alex . This is Water Street , Liverpool . This is where the incident took place around 6:00 p.m. yesterday evening . Now , you can still see that the area is cordoned off with police tape . You can see the police vehicle there . I do n't know whether you can make it out , but there 's someone there in a white forensic team boiler suit walking up . They 've been closely examining the site and the police , the community police are all around . This is still very much an active crime scene . Now , we 've just had a press conference from the police where they say that the man who has been arrested has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of reckless driving and also while driving under the influence of drugs . Now , charges still to be brought and it 's still an active investigation . Just to take you back to what happened here . again , around 5:00 p.m. for us , roughly about 24 hours ago , this area was teeming with tens of thousands of people . There were hundreds of thousands throughout the parade route . Remember , this was a Liverpool Football Club celebrating their victory in the Premier League . it was a historic victory . They have now won it so many times equal only to Manchester United . And so it was a big moment . It was also a public holiday , so there were no people at work , no one was at school , and that everyone came out to cheer on the te - board . Certainly , hundreds of thousands did . And this particular area , as the parade was winding down , was just packed with people . Now , what we understand from the police is that an ambulance was making its way slowly through the crowd , and this vehicle seemed to have come in behind it . At some point there was an altercation with Liverpool fans in the crowd at which point the vehicle appears on the videos from the scene that have been circulating online now part of police evidence to speed up through the crowd to veer to the and then veer to the left before stopping . You then see this angry crowd , this mob descending on the vehicle . The rear window is smashed . people trying to get inside . The police running up this street to try and intercept the crowd and trying to get to the driver . responding to those people who 've been knocked to the ground again up this street here . An incredible response from the police , from community police , from first responders , from ambulance and fire crews . There were four people trapped underneath the vehicle and the fire service had to deal with that . But we now know from the police that around 60 people in all were injured in this incident . 50 were treated in hospital and around 11 still remain there . Although the good news is that they 're responding well to treatment . Still more questions from the police . Still asking for more evidence , eyewitness testimony , as well as video evidence from the ground .

A US and Israeli backed group says it began delivering food to starving people inside Gaza despite objections from the United Nations . The UN says the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is attempting to bypass UN regulations and weaponize aid . Israel has been blocking aid for nearly 3 months to put pressure on Hamas . This comes as an Israeli air strike killed at least 52 people in Gaza , hitting a school that 's being used as a shelter . A girl was seen escaping the building with flames surrounding her . We 're told that she survived , but her mother and siblings were killed . Israel says it was targeting terrorists hiding inside of that building . So , for more on this , I want to bring in foreign correspondent Marcus Moore , who 's tracking the story for us . And and Marcus , what is the latest on Israel 's offensive in Gaza ? , , Alex . Israel has carried out numerous air strikes across several parts of Gaza of the Gaza Strip , including Gaza City . That 's where that school was hit . As well as Kunas where over the weekend a pediatrician nearly lost her entire family in a strike as she cared for patients at a nearby hospital . Nine of her children were killed ranging in ages from 7 months to just 12 years old . Another one of her children and her husband who is also a doctor . They were injured and were said to be in critical condition . , Israel has said that these strikes are targeting alleged Hamas command and control centers . The IDF claimed that they 've evacuated civilians from these areas for their own safety . But I think when you put all of this together , you get a real sense that at the very least there 's seemingly no safe place for innocent families to go and that the risk remains high wherever they retreat to . , and Marcus , aid is now getting into Gaza . , it looks that the UN specifically opposes this particular group or the way they 're going about it . But what does that look moving forward ? Is this going to continue ? Is more aid going to roll in ? , the hope , Alex , is that the aid will continue to reach Gaza and particularly the people who need it . And we 've begun to see images of aid being distributed today at one center in Gaza . The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has said that this they began to distribute that aid . but at the moment , Alex , it 's it 's unclear exactly how much aid has been distributed and to whom , but in principle , the idea is to open these distribution centers and provide enough aid to these families for them to eat for a week . we have seen images of people walking away with boxes that have flour and pasta and other food items . This food being distributed by private companies backed by Israel and the US . And as you mentioned , the UN and other aid groups have criticized this organization over their planned vetting of who gets the aid and also how it 's ultimately distributed . They 've been saying that it 's contrary to humanitarian law and that the food is being used as a weapon . But it 's also worth noting , Alex , that over the weekend the head of that organization abruptly resigned over those concerns . And the UN Secretary General has said recently that the aid currently going into Gaza amounts to a teaspoon when a flood of assistance is needed . Marcus Moore , thank you for that update ."

https://youtu.be/-5ClFUrdgYE?si=z7-twYyQ7dhcRNy6,Former Rep. Charles Rangel dies at 94,abc news,-5ClFUrdgYE,"Charlie Wrangler , a former congressman from Harlem and founding father of the Congressional Black Caucus , has passed away at the age of 94 . The Harlem native was one of the last remaining founders of the Congressional Black Caucus . He was known as the Lion of Lennox Avenue . Our reporter Kimberly Richardson from our partner station WABC looks back at his legacy . In the political arena , Congressman Charles Wrangle was a heavyweight . For nearly half his life , his family says tirelessly fought for everything from affordable housing to urban revitalization , fair tax policies , and equal opportunities for all Americans . He never stopped fighting . He never stopped being part of his community . He left the world a lot better place than when he entered it . Born Charles Bernard Wrangler on June 11th , 1930 , he was a proud Harlem native and from there made his mark on the country . Wrangle dropped out of high school , would later serve in the Korean War , where he was awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star . Once back home , Wrangle graduated from NYU and got his law degree from St. John 's University . that set in motion his storied political career , serving 46 years in the House of Representatives . In 1971 , Wrangle defeated another Harlem powerhouse , Adam Clayton Pal Jr. being a first was simply in his DNA . Wrangle was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus , the first African - American member of Congress to lead the powerful Ways and Means Committee . But in 2010 , he was found guilty of violating House ethics rules and was eventually censured . Even with the scandal hanging over his head one month earlier , constituents stood by his side , reelecting him . Wrangle was pardon of elite group of Harlem politicians known as the gang of four , David Dinkens , Percy Sutton , and former Governor David Patterson 's father . The same issues that he addressed in those days are now being torn down in these days . And that 's what I think is the only sad thing about his passing is we could have continued to use his voice and his strength toward equal opportunity in this country . A reputation for reaching across the aisle and getting things done . Among his colleagues , Wrangler was known as one of the hardest working lawmakers . We were in different parties , but we were good friends . He was loyal . was a true patriot . That relationship , something Wrangle discussed with Eyewitness News anchor Bill Ritter in 2020 . We 'd love the opportunity to make a contribution , and I really think , as John , the late great John Lewis said , we love to make trouble , good trouble . All . All . And our thanks to Kimberly Richardson for that reporting ."
https://youtu.be/upaJxBDJtV8?si=7_aPU7PGF_da70N8,JD Vance honors ‘the very best of us’ at Arlington National Cemetery,abc news,upaJxBDJtV8,", thank you everyone . Thank you to that incredible choir and band and thanks to General Kaine and Secretary Hexth for your powerful words . Thank you most importantly for everything that you do for our nation 's war fighters and for those who have given their lives to this country . We remember you today and certainly to our gold star families . We 're so thrilled and so grateful to have you with us in attendance . This is a sacred place , an eternal resting spot for our nation 's sons and daughters . We gather in solemn commemoration of their sacrifice and the sacrifice made by all those who gave up their lives in service to our beloved country . In 1915 , President Woodrow Wilson laid the cornerstone of the memorial amphitheater we gather in today . Now buried within it was a copper box which contained momentos of profound significance to the amphitheater 's designers and to our entire country . There were four things . An American flag , a Bible , a copy of our Declaration of Independence , and a copy of the US Constitution . and the objects they chose to dedicate to posterity . Those Americans remind us of the values we hold timeless and dear as a nation and as a people . But those values did n't spring from any stonework or time capsule . They were lived out day after day by the people buried in this hollowed cemetery . Each life honored here in Arlington was once full of the ordinary moments and quiet dreams , of early sunrises , of good days and bad days , of celebrations and disappointments . They stood not apart from us , but among us , ordinary men and women who chose to shoulder an impossible burden . And when we consider what they gave to us , it 's common , of course , to focus on their deaths , on the courage to give in that moment what very few are willing or able to sacrifice . But the real tragedy of the loss is not in a single moment of suffering , as our gold star families know well , but in all the future moments they and their families lost . every moment between their sacrifice on the battlefield and what would have been a natural death because we know they sacrifice not just their physical life . They sacrifice the moments that make that life worthwhile . They sacrifice a child 's embrace . They sacrificed walking their daughter down the aisle of seeing their husband or wife after a big promotion of sharing a meal with the family at Thanksgiving . For my fellow Americans , especially those watching on television , consider the sum of all the moments that make a good life . And now appreciate that countless strangers , people most of you never met , they gave up those moments in their own life so that we could enjoy them in ours . And that is what Memorial Day is all about . I once heard a Marine Corps colonel that I served with . He said this in 2005 , not long after a very tough deployment to Iraq . He said this about his fallen men that they were the best looking . They were the kindest . They were the smartest . They were the most devoted . They were the very best of us . To them , we owe everything . And today , in the peace they bequeathed us , we honor them as the book of wisdom tells us . But the righteous one , though he die early , shall be at rest . For the age that is honorable comes not with the passing of time , nor can it be measured in terms of years . They laid down their lives for Americans they would never meet , for generations yet unborn , for a nation that would not exist absent their incredible courage . Now , we know their families in particular have given so much . And in particular , I want to speak to the gold star families . To the families who have lost a son , a daughter , a husband , or a wife . To every child here who misses your dad or your mom . Know that your loved one to us is a hero . And though we can not know your pain , know that I speak for the entire nation when I say that we are grateful to them and to you for a debt none of us can possibly repay . Now , all of us will honor the fallen and their me families in our own way . But allow me to suggest two ways of honoring their sacrifice . Two ways that I try to honor their sacrifice every day . First , we ought to commit ourselves and expect from our leaders to treat the lives of our troops as the most precious resource . The very best way The very best way to honor the fallen is to only ask the next generation to make the ultimate sacrifice when they absolutely must . We must be cautious in sending our people to war . The second that I second way that I try to honor the fallen is to commit ourselves to being worthy of their sacrifice . If you 're a husband , be the best husband you can be . If you 're a mom , be the best mom that you can be . If you 're a citizen , be the very best citizen that you can be . Because together , let us build a better country , a more perfect union , and strive to be the nation worthy of the sacrifice of the people that we honor today . On this Memorial Day , let us remember that we have been given a great gift , often by people none of us ever met . Let us cherish that gift and make ourselves worthy of it . May God bless those who gave that gift and may he bless the country they sacrifice for . Thank you . [ Applause ]"

Scott Off is a professor at the University of Illinois who researches wartime communications .

With the help of the Navy , the organization used advanced robotics to search Hansa Bay in Papa New Guinea , and they found Toby 's plane . It was 215 ft underwater . DNA testing later confirmed the remains inside were his . And this past Friday , his body was finally returned home . He sacrificed so we could be free .

A man got up in the middle of the flight , thousands of feet in the air , tried to open the exit door . Had he been able to get to that exit door , we probably would have been talking about a completely different scenario .

A sailboat begins to sink with nine people on board . The captain refusing to abandon ship . ABC 's Melissa Adon live with more now . Melissa , tell us more about this rescue in the Bay Area and why it was made a little bit more difficult by the captain . , Phil . So , absolutely . Nine people , that was the distress call . the San Francisco Bay first responders rushing over to make that rescue mission . They were able to successfully get all of the other eight adults off of that vessel . Of course , the captain hanging on , he wanted to tow the boat . That 's what he was telling first responders , but you can imagine it was pretty choppy waters , it appears . And it also looks in that area there 's another rip current and rip tide warning out there really all along the California coast . So , that must have added to the challenge for those rescue crews that were on jet skiis and that were trying to safely make sure everyone was alive and . On the positive note , everyone made it out all . They all had life jackets on . That was key . And what we 're learning more about the vessel is that it is owned by a local sailing club that essentially teaches high school girls how to sail . So , but on board were these alumni from that from that group that are the teachers and they were part of a race that yesterday afternoon when all of this happened . Phil Melissa , we know people love to head to the beach to celebrate and relax , especially this weekend , but rip currents are often a risk this time of year . What can you tell us about that ? Absolutely . That is a major concern all throughout California . now , we have the sun out , the wind is blowing . It feels really nice out here . There 's of course tourists that are visiting and you think California year round beaches . That is the big warning from officials is to be careful . Parts of San Francisco officials are telling people to not even enter . Do n't even risk going into the water just in case you jeopardize of course your safety because that fill is the biggest risk as we were talking about as to when someone can get pulled in by a riptide . You can possibly drown . . And Melissa , we 've also heard about some early shark sightings . What are you hearing there ? Where 's it happening ? , that 's always has everyone on the edge of our seats . , we had recently seen one of the reports from Massachusetts not too long ago . And then what we 're hearing is ways to help combat that . over in New York , New York City 's Eric Mayor Eric Matt Adams , he was putting out some of these drones , this technology that they were to help out anyone who was out in the waters , but also technology to help spot any possible sharks . So , any shark sightings . So , that is really interesting and really cool for some of that to of course some of that technology to evolve because it will definitely help us keep us all out here safer . , interesting . And cool . as long as they keep their distance . Melissa Don , thanks so much ."

June 30th , 2025 is when all new car seats sold in the United States must comply with updated federal safety standards aimed at enhancing protection during those side impact collisions . And the changes stem from a multi - year research initiative by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which developed a new crash test simulating a 30 m per hour T - bone collision . And the regulation was finalized back in 20 excuse me , in , in 2022 , providing manufacturers with a three - year window to adapt their products to meet the new requirements , which is why we 're seeing it roll out now . Are families going to need to replace their current car seats ? . I spoke to someone at the NHTSA who said existing car seats remain safe to use provided they are not expired , have not been recalled , and are correctly installed . And they also emphasize that the current seats are effective in reducing risk of death or serious injury . And the new standards apply only to those seats manufactured after that June 2025 deadline . However , many manufacturers have already begun producing seats that meet that updated criteria . So , parents purchasing new car seats may have already been benefiting from that enhance from those enhanced safety features . Obviously , there were studies done and people thought about this a lot . I 'm wondering how do they say these new rules better protect children in side impact crashes ? I say , Phil , this gets a little technical , so stay with me . The updated standards introduce a new side impact crash test that evaluates how well a car seat protects a child during a t - bone collision . So , the test used advanced crash test dummies that represented a one - year - old and a three - year - old to assess the seat 's ability to restrain the child , prevent harmful head contact with the vehicle interior , and reduce crash forces to the to the chest . So , these enhancements address the unique dangers of side crashes , which are less frequent than frontal collisions , but they do pose a higher risk of serious injury or death for children . So , this really is a major advancement in child passenger safety and gives parents even more assurance that future car seats will be designed to protect kids in every type of crash scenario . . And whatever the change parents have to make , I remember when I was doing the car seats for the kids , anything that keeps them safer is what you want to do . Bethany Bron Silva , thanks so much . Always good to see Thank you ."

I did n't even think that was . 143 to 101 . Demolition of the Thunder . I obviously did n't see the game . This after two lopsided games in which the Thunder coasted to victories by doubledigit margins . in the Eastern Conference Finals . New York Knicks down 0 and2 travel to Indiana to face the Pacers tonight on their home court in game three . Joining me now is ABC News contributor and SiriusXM radio host Mike Muse . , that was a blowout , Mike . Good to see you . to get to 143 is impressive . let 's start with the Knicks , though . The Knicks were on fire going into this matchup . They beat the defending champions . I 'm still sore about that whole series . And now fans are calling these first two games , what are they calling , it 's their words , not mine , a dumpster fire . , and that crowd in Indie is not going to be friendly . Can they pull off a win on the road ? Phil , knowing you , I think those are your words , dumpster fire , but that 's exactly what it is . Look , you and I have been talking about the Knicks in the Celtic series for a long time now . And the Knicks were not expected to be in the Eastern Conference Finals . Let 's have to start there . The momentum coming into the series , both for Indiana and the Knicks . It was going to be an incredible series . These two games have been close , but my prediction was that the Knicks was going to have to win at least one of these two games at the Garden . When they are playing at the Garden , they have so much momentum because the crowd is there , ? You feel the magic in the arena . But for the Knicks to have lost both games in the Garden , by the way , Phil , in the second game against Indiana Pacers , the Indian Pacers star player Hallebertton was only held to 14 points . He did n't even have his best game . That is a sign that the Knicks are in trouble going into Indiana , going into their hometown . Halle Burton is not going to let that rest of having such a lowcoring game in the second game . You 're going to see the Indiana Bas come out with so much fire , so much excitement and you better believe how is going to be on his game and with that combination , it 's going to be difficult for the Knicks to come back and I think to really even win this series . I do n't see it for the Knicks . , and there 's a lot of bad blood between those teams over in the Western Conference . What 's with these huge lopsided games ? At least the Knicks and Pacers games have gone down to the wire . It 's a better series , I guess . , you 're absolutely . , what happened , what we saw with OKCh in their last game was miserable . SGA , the league 's MVP , had one of his worst performances , not just in this postseason , but in the regular season , too , as well . They were just dominated physically . And Phil , that is a disaster for OKC because of the fact of they are good on both sides of the ball , on offense and on defense as well . They 're one of the best defensive teams that the NBA has . And so for this to have the best NBA team be blown out by the Minnesota Timberwolves , that is a sign that this series is going to be possibly more competitive than we thought . I still think though that OKC has the assets to pull out to come out on the winner of the Western Conference . But Anthony Edwards is just incredible . And when him and Julius Randles his partner in crime on the court , when they lock up and when they 're in sync , they are a dynamic duel . That is what was able to propel the Minnesota Timberwolves to that victory yesterday . So , the key is if Minnesota wants to continue to win , Randall and Julius Randle and Anthony Edwards have to continue playing dominant basketball and being able to contain SGA defensively . All . Which is gon na be a problem . , it seems it . Mike Muse , thank you so much . Always good to see you . That 's it ."

On Saturday , Alnapon Airlines flight from Tokyo to Houston was forced to land in Seattle after a passenger tried to open an emergency door mid - flight . He was subdued by flight personnel and some other passengers on board . Law enforcement met the aircraft after it landed in Seattle . An airport spokesperson says the man was experiencing a medical emergency . Joining me now for more on this story is Morgan Norwood . Morgan , what more do we know about this incident , which must have been terrifying for people on that plane ? , me shaking my head . Incredibly terrifying . I can only imagine what those hundreds of passengers were experiencing at this moment . , how all of this played out , according to the airline and Seattle police . A man got up in the middle of the flight , thousands of feet in the air , tried to open the exit door . Had he been able to get to that exit door , we probably would have been talking about a completely different scenario . But thankfully , Phil , it was because of the quick thinking from several passengers who jumped into action , restrained the man using zip ties along with the help from flight crew , ended up having to land in Houston . It was coming from Tokyo or I 'm sorry , Seattle , coming from Tokyo bound for Houston . medical emergency according to authorities there on the ground . but they took him to the hospital to just re - evaluate him and make sure that it was n't anything super serious there . But we 're talking about a terrifying incident playing out during the height of the travel rush for Memorial Day , Phil . . And just I 'm curious . Glad he got the help he needed . Medical emergencies are scary specifically up there in the sky . Is he going to be charged with anything ? , it could be quite possible . , we 're waiting to get some more details from officials . We 've got a couple calls out to Seattle police to see what the latest is there . But certainly , Phil , we 've seen this happen time and time again , and it does seem that these incidents tend to ramp up , especially around these busy travel stretches . So , that 's one thing that we 're keeping an eye on . But the other thing is that Lipon Airways says that there was a second passenger once they landed that also got a little bit unruly . Both of those passengers taken into custody , but all around just seems a chaotic situation . But , it looks that flight did end up landing in Houston as planned . Phil . All , Morgan . Morgan , thank you ."

The intersection in Minneapolis , where the world witnessed that killing , is now named George Floyd Square . The center of 3 - day long rise and remember events . The events marking the death started off with a concert on Friday . Today 's remembrance include a Sunday service , a street festival , a self - care fair , and a candlelight vigil . The Floyd family also speaking to the media earlier on today . Joining me now with more is ABC 's Reena Roy . Reena , today marks this 5 - year somber . It 's tough to call it an anniversary because of what we 're talking about , but what did the Floyd family have to say at that newsroom ? , Phil , you can really hear just how much pain this family and this community still have five years after his death . His family members gathered at his grave site in his hometown of Houston . And it 's clear they want to make sure his name is never forgotten . Not just because of their love for him , of course , but because they are still fighting for justice in his honor , specifically when it comes to policing and race related issues in this country . George Floyd 's great niece spoke today at that press conference remembering him . Take a listen . My uncle means so much to me and I love him . And when I say George , you say Floyd . George . Floyd . George Floyd . Thank you . My uncle changed the world . Now , as you pointed out , there have also been remembrances for the last several days at George Floyd Square there in Minneapolis where he was killed . The community gathering there today for prayers and music . Again , they just want to make sure his life is celebrated and that people remember what happened there . After his death , there were a lot of gestures made by companies , the government as well . Now , the federal government , the DOJ , is dropping police reform agreements in Minneapolis and Louisville , Kentucky , , around the 5 - year mark . What do we know about that ? . , this anniversary comes at an especially contentious time . Just this past week , the Trump administration canled a settlement with the Minneapolis Police Department that called for an overhaul of the department there following Floyd 's death . The Biden administration had aggressively pushed for oversight there , but that has now been pulled back . As you said , the Trump administration also cancelling a settlement with the Louisville Police Department in Kentucky where Briana Taylor was fatally shot in her own home . And civil rights activists have of course been condemning this move , saying it is a slap in the face and will only deepen the divide between law enforcement and their communities . But it wo n't end the effort . . . It wo n't . So despite what 's happening federally there , , local and state authorities in both Minneapolis and Louisville have said that they will still , , move forward with reforms . Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey criticized the Trump administration 's move , saying that the city is serious about its commitment to police reform , though many activists have said they have not , seen enough change yet . So , we 'll have to see how this all plays out . All , on a on a very somber fiveyear mark of George Floyd 's death . Reena Roy , thank you ."

The president praising the cadets , calling them graduates of the Golden Age of America . His speech though comes at a pivotal time as commander - in - chief as he demands changes from West Point to the Pentagon over DEI policies and escalates his showdown with private ed educational institutions that includes Harvard University . The Ivy League school winning a temporary reprieve on Friday when a federal judge blocked the administration from barring foreign students at Harvard . To break this all down and look ahead is senior White House correspondent Selena Wang . So Selena , what did President Trump highlight in his speech and what has been the reaction thus far ? Morgan . And , the president , he congratulated the graduating cadetses and praised them for choosing this life of service . But he also used that speech as a chance to tout his America first agenda , also slamming his predecessors for what he 's calling nation building crusades . The president also highlighted his purge of diversity , equity , and inclusion programs across the US military . Now , in his first few days of his second term , President Trump had signed an executive order ending DEI programs in the armed forces . Now , some former West Point teachers as well as military members have been criticizing the president 's moves . And I just spoke with a former West Point professor who resigned from his position in protest . Take a listen to what he told me . These orders are to indoctrinate , not educate . they 're telling us what to think and what to think about . that 's not appropriate and we should n't be doing it . He also told me that he believes this administration is attacking academic freedoms . He said he felt his role at West Point was no longer tenable since he was n't able to pursue the research or the questions that he found critical . , to that point , let 's go there . Let 's zoom in on that , , Selena , because we saw that federal judge in Boston issued that temporary restraining order in favor of Harvard . But what 's the latest in this ongoing battle with that institution and what happens from here ? . So , the battle between Harvard and President Trump has been dramatically escalating and the Trump administration had banned Harvard from enrolling international students . And the Department of Homeland Security said that existing foreign students needed to either transfer or lose their legal status . So , Harvard then immediately sued the administration , calling this unlawful . A federal judge , as you mentioned , then siding with Harvard , temporarily blocking the administration 's moves . Now , this means that Harvard 's around 7,000 international students , about a quarter of its student body . It means their futures now hang in the balance with a hearing on this scheduled for next week . This comes after Harvard already had sued the Trump administration for blocking more than $ 2 billion in federal funding to the university after Harvard refused to comply with the government 's demands to change its admissions policies and end all of its DEI programs . , certainly all eyes on that hearing . While I have you , Selena , looking ahead to Memorial Day tomorrow , , what do we know about President Trump marking the day and what more do we know about that upcoming military parade ? So , it 's tradition for presidents to commemorate Memorial Day on hallowed grounds . And tomorrow , President Trump , he 's going to be going to Arlington National Cemetery where he 'll be participating in a wreath ceremony . And looking ahead to that military parade . It 's planned for June 14th . This is for the Army 's 250th anniversary . It also happens to coincide with President Trump 's birthday . It 's expected to include thousands of soldiers , tanks , armored vehicles , parachute jumps , concerts , fireworks , and NFL players . Now , Trump , he had also tried to hold a grand military parade during his first term , but it was scrapped after it was estimated to cost more than $ 90 million . Now , we do n't know how much this parade is going to cost this year , but it is expected to be steep . The White House says this is a chance to celebrate our country 's heroes who are keeping us safe . All , Selena Wang reporting ."

Ukrainian officials say at least 18 people were killed , 85 injured , and more than 80 residential buildings were damaged . These attacks not slowing down either despite the completion of the largest prisoner exchange of the three - year - old war between the two countries . ABC 's foreign correspondent Marcus Moore joining me now . Marcus , good to have you . , so we know Ukraine is now releasing those images capturing just the scale of the devastation there . Meanwhile , Zalinsky is saying the United States silence speaks volumes . What 's the latest on that ? . , it was a another violent and very a sleepless night for people in Ukraine . Once again , Morgan , for a second night , Russia pummeling parts of Ukraine , including the capital of Kev . We 've heard from Ukrainian officials that Russia launched nearly 400 drones and missiles at 13 different areas districts in Ukraine hitting dormitories and various civilian locations and as you mentioned there have been a number of casualties reported including deaths . It does give you a sense of how this war is continuing to unfold and how lives are being lost in the process . And all in the midst of this prisoner exchange that was concluded this weekend , three separate exchanges for a total of a thousand prisoners each . And Morgan , we understand that some 300 soldiers on each side were exchanged . You mentioned President Zalinsky in his comments on what he said the silence from the US and others . He has been calling for more sanctions against Russia to try to stop this war and one of the things he said is that the world may go on this weekend this weekend break . but the war continues regardless of weekends and weekdays . . And Marcus , we 're certainly seeing that . Let 's switch gear gears to Russia because have they come out to say anything about this ? And does this attack further underscore the lack of progress in the ceasefire talks that you mentioned ? , I think one of the things that the Russians have said is that they are open to peace , but what they want to see addressed or they say are the core issues that led to this invasion . and that 's one of the things that they have that they have said and this war will continue . nevertheless , one of the things that President Zalinsky has said is that Vladimir Putin is not interested in peace . In fact , that he is trying to drag this war out and what we have seen he will point to what we 've seen this weekend as evidence of that . Morgan . All , Marcus Moore , thank you so"

The community still healing from the pain of that shooting that lasted 77 minutes with gatherings taking place to reflect on that tragedy . Law enforcement waited more than an hour to confront the former student who opened fire inside the school . Recently , lawmakers passed a plan to prevent police failures but by mandating more training demanding better communication among agencies . Investigative reporter Daniellea Abara from ABC 's San Antonio Station joins me now . Daniela , we know there are going to be candlelight vigils later on tonight . How has this community really rallied around itself and healed over the last three years ? , Phil . , it depends on who you ask . I know for the families that process of healing , it 's going to take a lifetime . I know many of them say that they want accountability . They want answers , which they say they still have n't gotten 3 years after that shooting . We 've been here all day and some of the family members are out here inside of RA . They stood in front of the gate , which is something that they do n't do often . They stood out here for 77 minutes , which is how long it took law enforcement to confront the shooter . One of the parents told me that he hopes it sends a message , , that they want answers and they will continue to fight and they 're not going to stop . Daniela , I was there three years ago the day after this happened and I remember at that point there were agencies that brought dogs in to help people deal with the trauma even on that very day after the shooting . I 'm sure so many organizations are offering that help to the community . What 's available there ? . So earlier this month , we sat down with the CEO of the Children 's Briement Center of Texas . It 's based in San Antonio . And the CEO told me that when the shooting happened , she knew that she needed to be here . She and her team . So , they came out here in the days after the shooting . They 've helped thousands of children since that day three years ago . , one of the things that she said is that it was important for them to stay here to be here because that process of dealing with the grief , coping with the grief for these children is a lifong process . It absolutely is . What more can you tell us about the action lawmakers have taken because lawmakers were very vocal in the aftermath of this school shooting ? . So , I can tell you just this week two congressmen they partnered together to create a bipartisan caucus to address school safety and security . it 's a congressman who represents Ualdi and one who represents the Parkland area in Florida . And here at the state level , we know that families , they 've been pushing for gun restrictions here in the state of Texas . One of the laws that they 've been pushing is what they call the 21 for 21 . They want to raise the age limit to buy semi - automatic weapons from 18 to 21 . that 's something they 're still pushing for and this is something that they pushed for last legislative session and they say that still has n't happened but they say they 're going to continue to fight for it . Danielle , I 'm sure you have been covering this u pretty consistently for the last 3 years . , I know the victim 's families have a very certain set of circumstances they have to deal with , but also the survivors of that day , kids who were in that school , who were taken out eventually by law enforcement . How are they doing ? You must have spoken to some of them over the years . , we just saw some of them about an hour ago . They were all here in front of Rob Elementary School . You might not be able to see it , but there 's a big banner with a picture of all of them . , they were here . They want to make sure that people know that they 're still here . They 're still continuing to push for their friends and their teachers who died on this day three years ago . And they had a balloon release to honor their memory and of course just show the community that they 're still here and still pushing for those friends and family . Danielle Abara from KAT . , thank you so much for your time . Appreciate it ."

IDF soldiers secured the surrounding area . We 're standing here in this logistical area that the IDF built and will secure and will be run by a third party that will give the people of Gaza the aid directly . Every day , thousands of Gazins will be able to come here , reach this third party and get the aid directly . Thousands queued for food parcels desperate after an Israeli blockade on Gaza that 's lasted almost 3 months . But by mid - after afternoon , the numbers were so large that one site was overrun . There was chaos as people rushed to get food . There was shooting and we fled . We did n't take anything that would benefit us , help us get by given the famine that we are in . We did n't benefit . There was no order at all . They could not control the people because of the extent of the famine affecting society . The American contractors had to withdraw and there were sounds of automatic gunfire . The IDF denies firing on the Palestinians and there have been no reports of injuries . Aid organizations have criticized the initiative and refused to work with it . The foundation 's chief executive resigned on Sunday night , saying that the plan did n't meet his standards of humanity or independence . The organization 's source of funding has n't been revealed either , raising further questions . It is a distraction from what is needed , which is a reopening of all the crossings into Gaza , a secure environment within Gaza , and faster facilitation of permissions and final approvals of all the emergency supplies that we have just outside the border . The food boxes contain rice , flour , oil , sugar , and biscuits . The foundation says that it will open two more distribution centers and expects to feed a million people by the end of the week . The people of Gaza are at breaking point , though . The desperation and the security situation will only alleviate once aid starts entering Gaza in large volumes . The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says it can do that , but its critics , and there are many , will say that today 's stampede is proof they ca n't . Alistister Bungle , Sky News in Jerusalem ."

And then I did n't know anything at all was happening until Abby had started screaming my name , Jack . And then I put my phone down and looked up and then what happened was the car just started ramming through people . He had hit me and then at when he had hit my legs I just span around . So I had just about dodged the middle of the bonnet and then he clipped my legs or the side of his bonnet . The couple from Northern Ireland spoke to Sky News just a few hours after Jack was discharged from hospital with back and leg injuries . Got my hands and I pushed off his bonnet to save myself . So I pushed off his bonnet and I could n't find Jack . It was a good 5 minutes of looking for Jack . I was screaming , crying , absolutely traumatized . People were running everywhere , not knowing where anybody was . And all I heard Jack was shouting , "" I 'm here . I 'm here . "" And we ran up and he hugged me and next minute obviously with the whole atmosphere , you do n't know what 's going on . And he just fell against the wall and he says , "" My back , my leg , my back , my leg . "" From those who live and work in the heart of Liverpool , details are emerging of a community that pulled together when it became clear something terrible had happened . In the commotion , the landlord of the pig and whistle in a street next to where the incident took place locked down his pub . It was only when it was clear that it was n't really safe outside that I shephered the last few people in and locked up . Not knowing exactly what it was , just knowing that outside was n't currently safe . People got split up of course throughout the day . There 's so many people around . People could n't stay together . So everyone who was in the pub knew people that were outside , fellow friends , family , supporters . so people were worried and concerned . Just 20 minutes from where the collision took place is Anfield , the home of Liverpool Football Club . People are struggling to come to terms with what happened . how such a joyous day celebrating sporting success could end in the way it did .

It is with a deep sense of pride and pleasure that my wife and I join you here today as we witness Canadians coming together in a renewed sense of national pride , unity and hope . The main speech written by the government with a punchy message to the US . The prime minister and the president of the United States , for example , have begun defining a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the United States , rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations . That message reiterated in French in this bilingual country . Alia fi . As the anthem reminds us , the true north is indeed strong and free . At a time where Canada feels threatened by the US , having the king on side matters . It was a very successful visit . a good reminder of the strength of well of Canadian institutions . The speech from the throne brilliantly delivered I might add by his majesty and the enthusiasm for those institutions and even for me this trip was all about cementing Canada 's sovereignty . Two short days brimming with spectacle and symbolism using the king as head of state to show the US loyalties here lie with the crown . At the National War Memorial , solemn solidarity and a moment to reflect , remembering the past , but most importantly , strategically showing and strengthening the bond between Canada and the UK .

And that 's quite a big point . Until now , Ukraine has been fairly limited in the ranges it can use these weapons at . But now that restriction has taken off and there are three main types of weapons that were most interested in this respect . One is Storm Shadow , the British weapon . There 's also a French version called Scalp . It 's exactly the same weapon . That 's air launch and very capable . Another one is the Atakams , which is the American weapon launched from the ground . It 's a groundbased weapon , ground to ground . And the third one , the one that we 're most interested in really is the Taurus missile . Now , Ukraine probably does n't have any of these yet , but it may be getting them very soon . Not confirmed , but that looks the probability . And the Taurus missile has a better range and a much more sophisticated warhead than Storm Shadow or Scalp . And the reason that these weapons are so important in the next phase of this war is the range that they can cover inside Russia . If we look at a map of the ranges that these weapons may cover , think in terms of a firing point somewhere around the northern frontier of Ukraine , somewhere around Sunumi . That 's just a guess on our part , but you can see there how much of western Russia might be covered by these weapons . And there 's something else here . Whereas Atacams has got a fixed range . It 's ground to ground . Taurus and Storm Shadow are launched from aircraft . So their range is extended by wherever the aircraft goes . If a Ukrainian aircraft went into Russian airspace and released any of those weapons , then they go even further . And that 's why these weapons would have a big effect potentially on the next phase of the war because the Ukrainians could target the fixed areas of Russian reinforcements , the logistics hubs , the underground bunkers , the airfields , and even the concentration of armor and troops as we believe the Russians are preparing for a new offensive in the north of the country and in the southeast of the country . And that 's why the Russians are so angry about this statement . They 're making all sorts of frightening statements as they always do . They they normally talk about the danger of nuclear escalation . They have n't said it yet , but I 'd be surprised if they do n't say that in the next 24 or 48 hours . Do n't take it too seriously , but that 's where we are for now ."

James Matthews , how are you doing ? , very well . Nice to meet you . , tell me , , how do you assess the UK US trade agreement three weeks on ? , when will it be enacted and when will British industry feel the difference ? , the priority is to protect those jobs that frankly were vulnerable as a result of the initial tariffs in our auto sector , steel , and other sectors . and we 've got an agreement to protect those jobs , to safeguard those industries , and they will be implemented shortly . What what how do you assess its value ? I wonder 3 weeks after the agreement was signed given that the tariff remains at 10 % which many would regard as too high . , it 's a 10 % baseline . We 've now got to look at some of the effective tariffs in different areas and those discussions will continue . We 've also got to look at the non - tariff barriers that in some cases are too many or too high . So , this is part one of the trade agreement and we 're going to go on . We continue to negotiate with the US and I 'm pretty sure that the outcome will be very good for both sides and that of course also opens the door to a future technology partnership between our countries . On a different matter , sir . In June 2009 , did you stay at the apartment in Manhattan of Jeffrey Epstein ? I 'm not answering any questions about him . he was in jail at the time for soliciting prostitution from a minor . And my knowledge of him is something that I regret . I wish I 'd never met him in the first place . Why did you have an association with him ? Because he was in jail at the time . Why why did many people meet him ? He was a prolific networker and I wish I 'd never met him in the first place ."

The Israeli military says it was targeting militants operating from the school . But after a week that saw firm allies openly criticize Israel 's conduct today . German Chancellor Friedrich Mert said he ca n't understand Israel 's actions in Gaza which he added and I quote can no longer be justified . Our Middle East correspondent Alistister Bunk is in Jerusalem and a warning his report contains distressing images of a girl in a fire and of malnourished children . Silhouetted by the raging fire around her , a small girl looks for a way out of the inferno . As rescuers try to break through the windows , screams can be heard inside . [ Music ] Three missiles reportedly hit the school in Gaza City . Displaced families were sheltering in there . We can not show you many of the images . Some of the bodies are so charred it is impossible to recognize whether they were even boy or girl , man or woman . In some cases , only large chunks of flesh and limbs are all that can be retrieved of the dead . This is W , the girl we saw trying to escape the flames . She survived along with her father who is critically injured , though the rest of the family were killed . These rooms were sheltering displaced families , women and children who were asleep when the fire broke out . Their bodies were burned alive . Some of them were still screaming , but the intense fire made any rescue attempt impossible . This morning , once the fires had burnt out , this was what was left of the school . This is where they had sought shelter from the fighting . They will have to find somewhere else to live now . Some of the bodies were laid outside and mourned by survivors . The IDF admitted to carrying out the attack , but said Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters were using the school as a command center . They 're yet to provide any evidence to support that . Suddenly , I woke up and found my entire body trapped under the rubble with only my head exposed . My little son , just a year and a half old , was buried beneath it . My husband was under the rubble . All our children were too . I did n't know how to escape or whose blood was covering us . We could n't tell who the remains of the martyrs above us belonged to . Aid is still not getting into Gaza in the quantities needed . These children in Carunis are dangerously thin and malnourished . Assama here is 5 years old and has no fat on him . A mother shows a photo of what her daughter used to look . She now weighs just 6 kilos . The Israeli military operation in Gaza is escalating . Its entire standing infantry and armor brigades are now operating in Gaza . Tens of thousands of troops are on the ground . The IDF has now issued an evacuation order for the whole southern Gaza Strip except the Moasi humanitarian zone by the sea . They 're preparing to launch what they describe as an unprecedented attack on Hamas . Alistister Bunk , Sky News in Jerusalem ."
https://youtu.be/UxIdKyGzHlo?si=3C9Wc8gDrC5vm7No,President Macron's wife appears to push him in the face,skynews,UxIdKyGzHlo,"President Macron has had to play down an incident in which his wife appeared to push him in the face . The couple were arriving in Vietnam for a tour of Southeast Asia . As you can see from these pictures here , Mr. Macron said that he and his wife Brjit were just horsing around suggesting the incident have been overblown as some geoplanetary catastrophe . All , let 's bring in our Europe correspondent Adam Parsons for more on this . Adam , look , it is great to have you here with us and despite the hyperbolic language there used by Macron to play this down , that footage is going to be played on repeats until we hear from him again . It probably will be . . , social media is one of those places where Emanuel Macron pops up every now and then because there are a lot of haters out there who really do n't him . and sees on every opportunity to portray him as either an idiot or a villain or some nerd dwell . So , previously we 've had a suggestion that Emanuel Macron brought a bag of cocaine into a meeting of EU leaders . We 've had the suggestion that he had a secret handshake with the Turkish president Erdogan . And now whatever this is now obviously there was some something that happened between Manuel M and his wife Breijit as they arrived in Vietnam . Beyond that there 's not an awful lot that we can say for sure . She pushes him in the face . Is that because she 's angry ? Is that because she is I do n't know trying to take an eyelash out of his face . Then as they come down the stairs , certainly she seems as if she 's not very happy about something , he extends his arm as if to offer her support and she ignores that and comes straight down . But whether or not this is a titanic event or whether or this is simply two long married people who are having some tiff , , one imagines it 's more likely to be option two . I think in a sense possibly more interesting than the event is that knock - on . As you said , this will be played again and again . There are already I 've seen social media accounts examining this frame by frame . Did she assault him ? Is she furious with him ? What is this shun ? What is this cold shoulder ? there have been any number of ludicrous , frankly , conspiracy theories about Breijit Macron over the years . And so in a sense , what does Emanuel Macron do when confronted this ? , he probably does what he did , which is to laugh it off , to say that this is the latest in a number of conspiracy theories to say that it has been utterly overblown . But one thing that it will inevitably lead to is more investigation certainly by those within I guess particularly the French media who are antagonistic towards the president into exactly what happened aboard the presidential plane before it touched down in Hanoi ."

You can feel the anger from Vanessa and others living here in the shadow of the UK 's first drug consumption room where there are adverts attempting to lure addicts away from this lethal den . If we were to pick up every needle that 's here today , we 're talking hundreds . Hundreds . And we 're struggling to find somewhere safe to stand . I 'm standing here and I 've got needles between my legs . You 've got needles between your legs . You 've got needles behind your head at the side of your feet . There is no safe place to stand . How does it feel living in these conditions or living near these conditions ? Disgusting , soul destroying . It makes you angry . any level of empathy that you have starts to dwindle . And this is the center of this controversy , the taxpayer funded facility called the Thistle , where people bring their own heroin and cocaine and inject under NHS supervision . It opened in January . So far , 250 people have used it . The new rooms appeared and the problems escalated with it . But this is a community divided . Some fear their area is being wrecked . It 's a hospital gang . Somebody 's came . I 'll just pull it . and it 's got the blood on it . They 've just came out of hospital and dumped her down . This is the old school that they 've been using as a major shooting gallery . Officials have installed these needle bins in an area where drug misuse has been rife for years . There 's a nursery that uses a metal detector in the morning to scan the sand pits before the children go out because of the concern of the needles being on it . Just look at the devastation already . Demands for action demonstrated in this town hall meeting as authorities attempt to reassure . This has been a long - standing issue and one of the main reasons why the fistle has been placed where it is because there has been decades long discarded needles in public places . Locals say it 's got so much worse . It 's worse than it 's ever been in decades . And as I say , those reports do n't back that up . The council has not seen a rise in reports of injecting equipment and there 's not been an increase in crime reports , etc . So we need to take all of that into consideration . Locals are saying the area is littered with needles and it 's becoming a real problem . , we need to engage with the local community and that 's an essential part of all the work that 's been undertaken around the thistle to make sure we engage with the local community . The question is whether other harm is being caused as a byproduct in a community where tensions are high . Connor Gillis , Sky News , Glasgow ."

I 've seen I 've seen pictures and video of charred bodies coming out . Is it is an indescribable situation . 20 dead , at least according to the health ministry in Gaza . we 've been told 30 dead by some people who are on the scene and could rise further . no comment from the Israeli military as yet . so we will continue to see whether or not they will give a comment on this later but it looks another case where civilians and women and children in particular have been killed in part of this war . and then similarly Alli wanted to ask you about the news that the head of the USbacked Gaza aid group has resigned . Do we know why that is and what the potential implications are ? So , this is something called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation . If you 've not heard of it , I think you will do in the coming days . , it 's it 's a it 's a private company that has been set up ostensibly to deliver aid into Gaza and to bypass the established humanitarian organizations that already work there , whether that 's the United Nations or other charities . It 's very controversial . just this weekend there were big articles in the Washington Post and New York Times Herets 's newspaper here in Israel trying to investigate who is behind it , where 's the money coming from and most of them linking it back to Israel saying that this was a concept that was dreamt up by a group of Israelis perhaps connects to the government as well . and what the plan it to do is to have four hubs to deliver aid . Three in the very south and one in the center . Aid organizations have refused to be a part of it . They say they do n't want to be a part of it at all . They question where the money is coming from . They question the motive . They say that if you put a hubs in the south , what it 's doing is it 's effectively luring people towards the food away from the north . And , aid agencies say it is an effect effectively a method of ethnic cleansing . So they do n't want to be a part of it . And overnight the CEO Jake Wood has resigned on the eve of this coming into operation saying it is clear that it is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity , neutrality , impartiality and independence which I will not abandon . So , a really dramatic twist in this . The Israelis said this is the this is how aid is going to get to the millions of gardens . And we 've just heard that the foundation plans to start work today , but it is looking as though it is a messy start . And critics , of which there are many , will say the resignation of the CEO is exactly what we 've been saying all along . This is not an independent body . This is a body set up to do the Israelis work for them ."

Cardigan Bay is home to Europe 's largest population of bottl - nose dolphins . See , under us . under us . under us . under us . 250 animals feed and breed here . And scientists are looking for clues that might tell them why . Unique marks on their dorsal fins tell scientists which animals are hanging out together and where . But it is just a brief glimpse into their lives as they surface to breathe . In order to be able to conserve them properly , we need to know what 's important to them . So things what areas are important to them , what areas are they resting in ? What areas are they socializing in ? Where are they feeding ? What are those feeding areas ? What what species of food do we finding in those feeding areas ? And more importantly , what species are important to them for their survival ? Underwater microphones pick up the whistles of dolphins , a world of sound threatened by noisy human activity . The water is getting warmer , too . And genetic technologies revealing for the first time how they 're having to adapt . Cardigan Bay stretches for 70 m along the coast here , but scientists do n't understand what the dolphins are up to when they 're below the waves . To help them do that , they 're looking at their poo and extracting the DNA . Blink and you miss it . A dolphin ejecting a cloud of waste material into the water . With luck and nets , scientists catch it and bring a sample back to the lab . Analysis of the DNA tells them exactly what the dolphin has been eating . We are seeing large amounts of sardine , sprat and anchovi . And this is quite interesting because these are species that are known to have increased in abundance in Welsh waters in recent years in response we believe to climate change . The techniques are forensic , but the number of dolphins in the bay seems to be dropping and detective work could help establish whether it 's a natural cycle or a more sinister cause .

I think we 've done a lot of good work over the last couple of days . Being at West Point yesterday was incredible . What incredible people they are and I think it was a very big success and it was an honor to be there . Very importantly , we had some very good talks with Iran yesterday and today and let 's see what happens . But I think we could have some good news on the Iran front . Likewise with Hamas on the on Gaza . We want to see if we can stop that and Israel . We 've been talking to them and we want to see if we can stop that whole situation as quickly as possible . But having to do with nuclear , we 've had some very good talks with Iran and I do n't know if I 'll be telling you anything good or bad over the next two days , but I have a feeling I might be telling you something good . We 've had some real progress , serious progress . on any other front , I do n't know . Do you have any questions ? do you have a message for the Senate ? a lot of Republicans have said they 're going to be significant changes to the budget bill . , I want the Senate and the Senate and the Senators to change , , to make the changes they want and we 'll go back to the House and we 'll see if we can get them . In some cases , those changes maybe are something I 'd agree with , to be honest . , it happens . , but we 've had a very good response from the Senate . And I do n't know how Democrats ca n't vote for it . If they do n't vote for it , they 're talking about a 68 % tax increase . Remember that if the Democrats do n't vote , it 's a 68 % tax increase , which is ridiculous . And one of the things that 's being covered indirectly is the fact that we 'll be lowering the cost of drugs from 50 to 85 % under Trump . And it 's going to have indirectly something to do , not directly , but indirectly something to do with the with the bill , the one big beautiful bill . And it is a big beautiful bill . And so I think the Senate is going to get there . I hope they 're going to get there . I think they 're going to have changes . Some will be minor and some will be , , fairly significant . But we 've been working with the House all the way up . They 've been working together and the speaker has been working with the leader of the Senate and they 've done a great job . John Thun and Mike Johnson have done a fantastic job . They 've been working together all the way up . So hopefully that 'll be fine . President Trump and President Trump who 's under federal investigation . do you have a comment on that and how that should impact the mayoral election coming up ? , I was surprised . I did n't know exactly . I just read about it just you did having to do with Andrew . I 've known Andrew and we 've had an onoff relationship . He was saying the greatest things about me . I 'm the greatest president , etc . And then the next day it hit us , but I did a lot for them . I brought in the ship during the COVID crisis . I brought in the Mercy ship and I built about 3,000 units in the Javitz Convention Center . And he did n't use them . I do n't understand it . He wanted them , but he did n't use them . But I hope it 's going to be . I hope it 's not going to be serious for him . Let 's see what happens . You spoke to European Commission President Bander Lion . Did you discuss the 50 % tariffs and did you agree to She just called me as and she asked for an extension on the June 1st date and she said she wants to get down to serious negotiation because I 've told you specifically I told anybody that would listen they have to do that and we had a very nice call and I agreed to move it . I believe June 9th would be July 9th would be the date that was the date she requested . could we move it from June 1st to July 9th and I agreed to do that and that she said we will rapidly get together and see if we can work something out . Another question you announced on Friday about US Steel and Non Steel . What will the ownership structure look ? What made you satisfy ? It 'll be controlled by the United States otherwise I would n't make the deal . I went to the unions to the all of the local unions . They all wanted it and I 'm doing it because all of the congressmen came in about five of them and the others I understand are in concurrence and they asked that I do it . Everybody seems to want it and we 'll see . , , we 'll see what the final is . But they 're going to invest billions of dollars in steel and it 's a good company . Nissan 's a very good company . We 'll see . But it would it 's an investment and it 's a partial ownership but it 'll be controlled by the USA . President Trump on Saudi Arabia , you came back with a lot of investments . there 's an American who 's stuck there and facing a trial for weeks . his family want you to intervene and ask the crown prince to let him go . What do you think about that ? I have n't heard about it at all . If you give me the information on the plane . Are you on the plane ? Give me the information . I 'll see what I can do . Do you think he 's ? I 'm a reporter . I ca n't . Are you giving a recommendation ? , I 'm not . . , then maybe I wo n't do it . I do n't know . You tell me . The way you the way you posed the question , I thought you assumed it was he was . What did he do ? Supposedly sent some political tweets about Saudi Arabian politics . Were they bad ? , he said he approved of naming a street , renaming a street in DC . , it was fairly innocent stuff by American standards . Let me take a look . Can you provide us an update on Russia and Ukraine as well ? , I 'll give you an update . I 'm not happy with what Putin 's doing . He 's killing a lot of people and I do n't know what the hell happened to Putin . I 've known him a long time . Always gotten along with him , but he 's sending rockets into cities and killing people and I do n't it at all . , we 're in the middle of talking and he 's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities . I do n't it at all . So , Mr. President , what do you want to do about that ? And I 'm surprised . I 'm very surprised . We 'll see what we 're going to do . What am I going to tell you ? , you 're the fake news , are n't you ? You 're totally fake . All , any other questions ? I do n't what Putin is doing . Not even a little bit . He 's killing people and something happened to this guy and I do n't it . And can I follow up on that ? A Russian commander reportedly said that Putin was almost caught in the middle of a drone attack from Ukraine . So , do you have any I have n't heard that , but maybe that would be a reason . I do n't know , but I have not heard that . President Trump , , Secretary Hex 's acting chief of staff , , is a Biden administration holdover who has said some very critical things about you and Vice President Vance . , your thoughts on that ? Who is the chief of staff ? Ricky Berea . I have no idea who he is , but if he did say that , I would recommend that we do n't take him . , if he did say something that , , I would recommend we do n't take him , but let 's see . I 'll take a look . Korea , I 'll check it out . . on Harvard . Do you think you 'll come for their endowment in any way or go after financial aid ? Look , part of the problem with Harvard is that there are about 31 % almost 31 % of foreigners coming to Harvard . We give them billions of dollars , which is ridiculous . We do grants , which we 're probably not going to be doing much grants anymore to Harvard , but they 're 31 % , but they refuse to tell us who the people are . We want to know who the people . Now , a lot of the foreign students we would n't have a problem with . I 'm not going to have a problem with foreign students , but it should n't be 31 % . It 's too much because we have Americans that want to go there and to other places and they ca n't go there because you have 31 % foreign . Now , no foreign government contributes money to Harvard . We do . So , why are they doing so many ? Number one . Number two , we want a list of those foreign students and we 'll find out whether or not they 're . Many will be , I assume . And I assume with Harvard many will be bad . And then the other thing is they 're very anti - Semitic . Everybody knows they 're anti - semitic and that 's got to stop immediately . President Trump secretary , are you in ? New York Post . , I the New York Post . I Keith Pool . . So , Secretary could be nicer to him . I did n't know he was with Go ahead . Secretary Bessett has said that we do n't need to return textile manufacturing to the United States . How do a lot of your reciprocal tariffs are pretty big on those low - income countries ? . , I tend to agree . We 're not looking to make sneakers and t - shirts and we want to make military equipment . We want to make big things . We want to make do the AI thing with the computers and the many elements . But the textile , , I 'm not looking to make t - shirts to be honest . I 'm not looking to make socks . We could do that very well at other locations . We are looking to do chips and computers and lots of other things and tanks and ships meaning ships . . You mentioned you are happy with the talks with Iran . Will there be another round of talks soon ? very soon . Iran the Iran talks . I ca n't tell you what 's going to happen tomorrow . I can tell you the Iran talks have been going very well . And you said you 're in I 'd love that to happen because I 'd love to see no bombs dropped and a lot of people dead . I really would to see that happen and I think there 's a good chance that it could happen . You mentioned you 're unhappy with President Putin . You 've talked before about putting more sanctions on Russia . Is that something you 're considering more serious ? Absolutely . He 's killing a lot of people . I do n't know what 's wrong with him . What the hell happened to him ? . He 's killing a lot of people . I 'm not happy about that . Go ahead . What else ? Anything else ? There was just a person arrested for attempting to apply in Israel to throw Molotov cocktails at a US embassy office in Tel Aviv . . The person also reportedly who 's a dual German US citizen issued threats against your life . Against my life . Against your life . , sir . We 've got a lot of them around . We got a lot of sick people around . Thank you very much everybody . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/K7nzH8eSQxc?si=bxQBanRXFTh0PxuA,Premier League clubs at risk of legal action over unlicensed casino sponsors,skynews,K7nzH8eSQxc,"On the final day of the Premier League season , teams with sponsors placing club officials at risk of prosecution . They 're all online casinos we found are accepting UK customers despite having no license . And the Gambling Commission has been warning clubs about the potential consequences of the sponsorships , telling them to seek assurances their websites are not accessible in Britain by any means , including through VPNs . But Sky News was able to use virtual private networks to sign up to six websites and access QR codes to make cryptocurrency deposits . This is BC Game on Lester shirts in a 2 - year 30 million pound deal . Now , they allowed a UK number to be registered , the only firm we investigated to check the number was genuine . These are some of the others that we signed up to . DBET , the principal partner of Wolverampton Wanderers . Bournemouth 's backer BJ88 , Fulham sponsor SBO Top , and there 's Fun88 , Newcastle United 's former shirt sponsors , now their Asian betting partner . And there 's 96.com on the shirts as Burnley game promotion back to the Premier League . For that site , Sky News signed up using a Telegram account registered to a UK phone number . For all six sites , we did not attempt to make any deposits . But campaigners from the Coalition to End Gambling ads told us they did manage to use VPNs from here and then deposit cash with the sponsors of Leicester , Wolves , and Burnley . All three gambling firms were previously licensed in the UK by TGP Europe , a company based on the aisle of man . The Gambling Commission have welcomed my investigation and have asked for a little advice as to how I access one of the websites , which was slightly concerning given I expected them to be the experts and they said they were going to verify it themselves . But they are receptive to what I 've done , but they ca n't update me because there may well be a criminal investigation going on , albeit it 's taking far too long . Far too many children , far too many football fans are seeing these adverts every day . It 's got to stop . The Gambling Commission has been warning clubs their officers could face up to 51 weeks in jail and unlimited fines if found to be promoting firms that are former TGP Europe affiliates . Letters have been sent to Leicester , Newcastle , Bournemouth , WS , and Fulham . And fans of the West London club are concerned about their choice of sponsor . There must be people or companies out there they could use rather than betting companies . But on the other hand , it does seem that betting is now so linked to football and other sports . I do n't see how they can get away from it . I think it 's definitely a good idea to discourage gambling and if I go into the club shop here to buy a shirt , that would definitely influence my decision on what I buy . There was no comment from the six football clubs or TGP Europe , but the Gambling Commission told us where we have evidence that meets the standard for criminal prosecution . We will take appropriate action . Next season will be the last any gambling companies can appear on shirts in the Premier League , but they can still be club sponsors . How much harm has been caused exposing fans to these companies ? Rob Harris , Sky News ."

Ukrainian officials say it was the biggest aerial attack yet in 3 years of war . Overnight , Russia launched nearly 300 drones and 70 missiles at Ukraine . It does n't come without casualties . 12 - year - old Tamara and her brothers Stannislav , who was eight , and Roman , who was 17 , all died when their home was hit . They were among at least 12 civilians killed across the country . Keith Kellogg , the US special presidential envoy to Ukraine , said the indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva peace protocols designed to protect innocents . These attacks are shameful . Stop the killing . Ceasefire [ Applause ] now . Rescue workers occasionally shout instructions . The rest of the time they work quietly . Earlier Ukraine 's leader had criticized the global silence . In a post on social media , President Zalinski said , "" This can not be ignored . Silence of America , silence of others around the world only encourages Putin . The world knows all the weaknesses of the Russian economy . The war can be stopped , but only through the necessary force of pressure on Russia . Putin must be forced to think not about launching missiles , but about ending the war . Meanwhile , in a sign that end is nowhere near , the Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses had shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight . All this escalation at the same time as a moment of compassion from both sides . 303 Russian soldiers released from Ukrainian captivity in exchange for the same number in the other direction . A total of a thousand prisoners from each side released over this 3 - day exchange . This is the schizophrenic state Ukraine is in and indeed the rest of the world is in . We do n't know what it is Russia is trying to achieve . At the very same time the president exchange takes place , Russia then proceeds to launching a really fierce attack that has claimed the life of lives of Ukrainian civilians . The landscape of this conflict has shifted this weekend and yet it can also look nothing is changing . Sardia Chowry Skynes ."

Especially in a week when William and Kate have made it into Time magazine , praised for modernizing royal [ Applause ] philanthropy . Partly , it seems , spurred on by a desire to shift the dial on what global leadership really looks . , over the past 20 years , Tessy Ojo from the Diana Award says he 's always had that compulsion to do things differently . What people 40 years ago wanted from their monarch was completely different . I think it 's really super important that , , as the hair , as the next monarch , he 's very in tune with what the people want and what the people expect . and being able to be that monarch , be that 21st century monarch who is a present dad , but also a leader who understands how to use your leadership for social good . Impact is the word you 'll hear ahead of any of his engagements . This trip to Leath in Edinburgh , launching the latest social impact project for his royal foundation . David Juke from Street Soccer used to be homeless and has connected with the Prince through their work . Would everyone do the same as he does ? , I always ask that question . And for me , I just think , , he 's he 's got a voice that can travel further than ours can . and the fact that he wants to give up his time to support a cause ours and others across the UK , then I 'm all in . As heir to the throne , there were lots of different titles that he had to take on , but one that he seems to be shaping for himself is as a quiet disruptor , albeit still within that very traditional institution . And while he is trying to do things a bit more subtly than other members of the family , it is at times still setting him up for criticism . I 'm sorry , sir , but her royal highness is the winner of Jack . As a couple putting family first , it means engagements this now fit around things the school run and school holidays . On paper , that means fewer visits and some even using the word workshy . But their family focus appears to be something that people admire . If you follow the royal family , maybe that would be a natural progression to look up to them . If they 're putting their family first , maybe that 's a good that 's a good thing . Just doing things with his family and his wife , looking after her . Why should we do things with the old Monarchy used to do ? He should just be doing his own thing . They 're having to behave in a certain way because obviously that 's how royalty is , but they 're trying to show that they do live us really . Chosen a daddy a year to come on . We all walk around with umbrellas . No one can see anything . It does make you wonder what 's going to happen to the more traditional aspects of raw life when he does lead the firm full - time . His views on how things should change will be much more consequential than those in the family who 've tried to be more noisily disruptive . Rian Mills , Sky News ."

Under new government reforms , they 'll soon have much more room to roam with the enclosure here set to become three times bigger . We 're goldplated here at Chester Zoo . , we 're one of the top zoos in the UK , but we 'll continue to evolve and continue to change . , we welcome the standards being launched today . , it 's been a few years in the making and we 've been working really hard with DERA and other agencies to be able to get them launched . The new standards of zoo practice is the biggest overhaul the sector has seen for over a decade . As well as larger enclosures , the tethering of birds of prey will be phased out . And there 'll be a strict no touching policy in aquariums . Rules already in place here . Zoos and aquariums now have two years to put their plans in place for this major reform with the government telling them this is about conservation and compassion for animals in captivity . But some animal welfare groups say the reforms do n't go far enough . It is really challenging to keep elephants in captivity with high welfare . This is something that the RSPCA raised more than 20 years ago . And we 're still seeing really serious welfare problems with high death rates , low birth rates , a lot of health and welfare problems . And so the species really challenges whether that 's even feasible in the zoo environment . Even these measures only go part way . birds of prey , for example , can still be tethered for four hours a day . And the ban on touch pools only applies to some species . , so these changes that we 're seeing as a result of these standards do n't go nearly far enough and they do n't solve the fundamental problem that wild animals simply do not belong in captivity . Zoos will also need to place a greater focus on educating the public so visitors know how to treat animals with respect . I think it 's nice for the children to be able to interact with the animals . But I think , , so long as the animals are happy and they 're in the most comfortable environment for them , then that 's what 's most important really . If it can be perhaps controlled or something that , I think that would potentially work . But I think to lose it as well would n't be great either . It 's finding the balance . , I think they should . And morally , , this historic family day out is being modernized to put an end to outdated practices and provide animals with the highest levels of care . Charlotte Leming , Sky News , Chester Zoo ."
https://youtu.be/56AFPc4MWOc?si=JtOhSGLwMU9bUc-p,Surgeon on the latest strike in Gaza: 'It's something we'd never want to see',skynews,56AFPc4MWOc,"Perhaps you could start by describing the type of injuries that you 're you 're treating and seeing and how tough it is to treat people under these conditions . . . Thank you . , the majority of the injuries we 're treating are blast injuries . So fractures involving lower limbs , upper limbs , massive wounds with missing parts , amputations , severe burns . It 's it 's pretty much what we are finding . And it 's really tough to treat these injuries with the very little that we are that we have available here . we are running into we running short of loads of things at the moment . So yesterday one of the nurses was telling me that we 're really short on causes other medical supplies such as gloves very basic things and it 's very difficult to treat this injuries if population is really malnourished and we are very we are very short and we have very small variety of antibiotics . , and I appreciate it 's hard for you to talk about specifics , but the news today of those nine siblings being killed , the children of two doctors based where you are at NASA hospital , it must have hit the medical community particularly hard . , it 's it 's it 's not unfortunately it 's not the first time this happens and it 's really heartbreaking as every other person that we receive here wounded or severely injured . yesterday we had this last night we have we received the husband of this pediatrician who is working who was working at the time her house was hit by an air strike and she lost nine out of 10 of her kids and her husband is severely injured . So , absolutely . It 's it 's something that we would never want to see , of course . And you talked about signs of malnutrition , and we 're hearing about the dangers of starvation , particularly amongst children and babies . Are you seeing signs of that ? Just describe what you 've experienced . , absolutely . we struggle to figure because when compare when we compare the age that we see on the on the medical notes and then we see the actual patient it looks completely different . So if a patient is reported for to be seven year old and then when them sometimes they look four they 're they 're so tiny so little so thin and that makes everything much more difficult because wounds do n't heal if people are malnourished also the there has been I 've seen many patients that we could n't even operate on just because their weight is too is too low . They would they would n't be able to recover from an anesthetic or from a dressing or a debrightment in theater that would that would involve loss of blood . So it 's it restricts a lot what we what we can do of course and we 've seen a lot of hospitals being damaged , some now completely out of action . is that something else that you fear that where you are could also suffer that as well ? So on Tuesday when the when the evacuation order came up , we were really worried that because it 's really the area that has been ordered to be evacuated is really near our hospital . So our worry was that if they 're going to close Nasser Hospital and the hospital has to be evacuated , this is one of the last big hospitals that has ITUs , oxygen generators , big operating room that ca n't provide high complex types of surgeries . So if this is going to be evacuated , loads of people will just die . and you 're having other Sorry , I was going to say that you 're having to work whilst this violence is going on around you as well , which must be not only terrifying but also concerning , especially if you 're in the middle of a procedure or an operation . , it 's it 's not it 's not ideal . we are operating about 12 hours a day . the volume of patient that we receive is absolutely incredible and we never stop and we operate roughly 10 11 patients a day and they 're all big cases and then we come back in the in the accommodation which is still in the hospital and all we can hear is bombs and drones over our heads . So it 's it 's it 's definitely not the best , but this is something that we are experiencing for a short time and I just ca n't believe how these people have been managing for so long . Of course , and given everything that you 're having to witness and you 've not been in Gaza a huge amount of time , how do you look after your own tiredness levels , stress levels , and mental health ? So this is my first time here in Gaza . we are a group of five UK surgeons who we are four surgeons and one anist and we are trying to alternate especially now to try to relieve each of us from the pressure in the other because we 're started being to feel this stress and the fatigue"
https://youtu.be/ZFYzbtH3Fc8?si=H5w6eeIKfjNDfnBc,Why Russian troops are massing near Ukraine's 'fortress city',skynews,ZFYzbtH3Fc8,"Kev came under a sustained drone attack and missile attack last night lasting 7 hours . Reportedly , 250 drones were used and 14 ballistic missiles . It sent the population again underground into the tube stations to shelter for most of the night . And there are indications that there were other attacks in other parts of Ukraine in the south and further east and as far west as Odessa . So that air operation on the Russians part goes on . But the Ukrainians hit back themselves on Yellets last night . they claimed to have hit a battery factory on the Russian side of the border deep inside Russia in fact at Yellets . And the battery factory creates batteries , manufactures batteries for missiles . And so Yellet itself is a not a particularly important town , but the battery factory is because without batteries , Russia 's ballistic and cruise missiles ca n't easily operate . We have no idea how much damage the Ukrainians might have done to Yellet 's battery factory . They claimed that they had a big hit on it , but we 'll see . But if they were able to interrupt the supply of batteries to missiles , then arguably they can do something about the number of ballistic and cruise missiles that are being targeted against Ukraine more or less now on a nightly basis . Meanwhile , the ground war goes on and attention at the moment is concentrated on Kharkiv and the area in the north of Ukraine . Kharkiv is the second city . It 's only less than 20 miles away from the border and reportedly the Russians are massing troops on their side of the border . Ukrainians have been talking about this for several weeks now and the expectation is that they 're going to launch some offensive in the north against the Khakiv area and further northwest against Sunumi which is another major city in the north of Ukraine . Almost certainly the Russians wo n't be able to take Khiv . It 's the second city . It 's a big city . They never got really near to taking it in 2022 when they really did try . Nor can they probably take Sum . we have cities . But what they probably can do is get over the border and begin to put pressure all the way along this border . What the Russians say , and they 've making this fairly clear in Putin 's statements , is that they want a buffer zone all the way along the front to protect them from Ukrainian attacks . From a military point of view , that 's neither here nor there . It 's not what they want . What they want to do is to create pressure along the border to pin Ukrainian forces in place so that those Ukrainian forces ca n't go further south where they 're now badly needed for the summer offensives which the Russians are also pursuing in the south . And the other reason that they might want forces on the Ukrainian side of the border is it gives them a foot in the Khakiv oblas the Khakiv region and the Sunumi region . And if they have a foot in those regions , then in any future negotiations , and we 're a long way from them at the moment , but in any future negotiations , they will say , "" We 're already in those regions . We will keep that footprint . "" And of course , we want more , just as we want more in the four other oblasts that we have a footprint in , but we have n't fully conquered . So , the politics of this overlays all of the military activity . And not least , the politics of this comes into the prisoner exchange , which is ongoing at the moment . Yesterday about 500 prisons were exchanged on each side , 500 each . And today another 350 odd on each side . We expect these prisoner exchanges to go on again tomorrow until both sides have exchanged a thousand prisoners as they agreed to do last weekend at the Istanbul summit . This is all good in itself . It 's a humanitarian gesture . Both sides want it . But in reality , it does n't take us any nearer to a ceasefire . In fact , if we think about it logically , we are probably further away from a ceasefire now in Ukraine than we were about a month ago ."

They do n't have much to celebrate usually around here . No wonder every corner of the high road was filled , every vantage point taken . However precarious . on the stage . You can really feel here what India Trophy drought means to a club , a fan base and a community that 's been starved of success for so long . And what 's even more surprising perhaps is that the Europa League has been one while Tottenham have been enjoying their worst domestic season in five decades . But none of that 's on the mind tonight . It 's all about celebrating . Two days on , players and fans still savoring the sweetness of beating Manchester United . We have lifted a major trophy , European trophy for the first time in 41 years . Last time Spurs won a European trophy , I was 3 years old . Just just mental . I could n't believe my eyes .

A double dose of celebrations for Brennan Johnson , the score of the only goal in the final 24 today . He 's never had a bigger party . And so many doubted if this day would ever come again to Spurs , especially with this manager . I told him and I did n't believe , but here we are . Tottenham have secured more than silverware . the promotion two into the Champions League , one of a record six English teams next season , contesting Europe 's most prestigious and lucrative competition . Spurs reached that final and lost in 2019 . It was just the latest miserable chapter for fans . Did you ever question whether this trophy would come again ? , it 's always coming . Second season . Come on . The Tottenham Trophy Cabinet finally has a new addition and renewed belief it wo n't be so long until they 're parading and partying here again . Now the winning feeling is back .

https://youtu.be/Y4whl4oiDjQ?si=kxR1F5h7nzLyreji,‘What is it if not a war crime?’ Former PM accuses current Israeli government actions in Gaza,cnn,Y4whl4oiDjQ,"Opposition to the war is growing inside of Israel as well . Among those speaking out is the country 's former prime minister , Ehud Olmert . In a new opinion piece for Haaretz , making headlines around the world , he says Israel is committing war crimes . And he joins me now live from Tel Aviv . Mr. Prime Minister , thank you so much for taking the time . Your criticism of this government and how it 's been conducting this war is not new . You have been outspoken on that front for many months now , but going to this level and saying that Israel is , in fact , committing war crimes is something entirely different . I want to read from your piece . You said what we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation , indiscriminate , limitless , cruel and criminal killing of civilians . We 're not doing this due to some disproportionate outburst by some soldiers in some unit . Rather , it 's the result of government policy knowingly , evilly , maliciously , irresponsibly dictated . , Israel is committing war crimes . So what has changed in your view , and why are you speaking out publicly and globally now ? , as you said before , I 've been speaking for a long period of time and I criticize the Israeli government and particularly the lack of any vision about what comes next . What are we going to do in order to end the war ? Release the hostages and start to move towards some a political horizon that , will start perhaps a process that will end the military confrontations . What happened particularly in the last few days , was the statements made by Israeli , cabinet ministers , the leading cabinet ministers that say we should stop Gaza . What is it , if not a war crime ? , how can a serious person , representing the Israeli government , can spell it out in such an explicit manner that we should starve Gaza , that there should be no , supply of basic , fundamental , humanitarian needs to a couple of million people living there . They are , terrorists that , we need to fight . But this is not a war against Hamas . This looks more and more a political war of the Israeli prime minister in the cabinet , in the group of thugs which are now representing the Israeli government inside Israel . And , of course , the world , committing , actions which ca n't be interpreted in any other way . As we have noted , calls of condemnation and threats of additional sanctions and a reevaluation of trade partnerships among traditional allies have now been dominating news headlines over the past several days . I want to play sound from , German Chancellor Merz on this as well . What the Israeli army is now doing in the Gaza Strip ? Frankly , I no longer understand what the objective is to inflict such suffering also on the civilian population , as has increasingly been the case in recent days . Can no longer be justified on the grounds of a fight against Hamas terrorism . We even hear from President Trump , who has not gone to those lengths but has said that the war should come to an end when you have allies that making comments , to this degree and even threatening , implications for trade relationships . What does that mean for Israel and its increasing what appears to be isolation on the global stage ? , certainly it looks it 's and it 's , very sad . I must say that I though listen to what , the new chancellor of Germany said , and , I know he 's a friend of Israel as Prime Minister Starmer or , President Macron and Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Meloni , and the , ministers and prime ministers of so many other countries and President Trump , President Trump is held , by most of the Israelis to be a great friend of the state of Israel . He also says that , we should supply the basic fundamental needs of the people of Gaza . They ca n't starve . And , I think that , the , international condemnation of the policies of Netanyahu and , the , group of ministers and messianic extremist wingers that are now leading the government and dictating to Netanyahu what should be done and how it should be done . I think that , they have to listen to what the international community says and to change direction . And I personally hope that President Trump , will take the lead in making this effort . I think that no one but him can summon Netanyahu , to a place they both love very much , which is the Oval Office facing the TV cameras . And he should do it . And say to Netanyahu , enough is enough . It 's time to end the war . It was a time , long time ago , but it certainly is today to end the war , to supply volume and Syria needs of the people that are uninvolved in terror . And there are many of them , and release the hostages and move forward . It 's time . Why do you think he has n't done that thus far ? He had an opportunity when he was in the Oval Office just a few weeks ago , and by all accounts , seemed to embarrass the Prime Minister by , announcing that he 's going to be speaking with Iranian officials about a potential nuclear deal . Why not do this , then ? Look , , how many people do in the world that can interpret and analyze President Trump ? I 'm not one of them , I do n't know . I think that he cares . And I respect him for this because he spelled it out in , numerous occasions in the last couple of days , in Washington . So , he did n't do it a couple of months ago . It 's time to do it now , and I hope he will do it . I really certainly think that he is the only person , perhaps , that can force the Israeli prime minister , to come to terms with reality and that he 's the moral reality of what is being accomplished by his government . Mister Prime Minister , in just the last few moments that I have you , I do want to get you to , weigh in on your views on where things stand with Iran negotiations and the increased reporting . We 've seen that if , in fact , these talks fall through , that Israel may be prepared to launch imminently , do you think that is what Prime Minister Netanyahu would do ? Look , you have to distinguish between what he can do and what he says . The rhetoric of Netanyahu is , well known , and we are all acquainted with the , political , threats that he poses to the Iranians . I still , believe that there is , a good chance that , President Trump , will succeed in these negotiations . He say just the other day that , there are good , signals coming from these negotiations . Obviously , Iran is a threat , and he 's a danger not just to the state of Israel , but to the entire region and perhaps to the entire world , and no one better than President Trump is aware of that and is prepared to deal with it . And he say time and again that if , Iran will not come to terms with America about the nuclear , then the bad things will happen . I hope that there will be an agreement , and I hope that this agreement will make sure that there is a strict supervision about any future plans of Iran towards the nuclear , Trump state and President Biden before him and President Obama before them . They all say that America will not allow Iran to have a nuclear bomb . I hope that the president will take care of this . And in any event , I do n't think that this is incumbent to Israel to attack Iran , because I think that America can deal with it either by negotiations or by a military action in a much more effective manner than the rhetoric of Netanyahu . Ehud Olmert , thank you so much for your time and for joining us . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/USwcyA7B05w?si=ZXeSHSI1Gd0Iq_aW,Why Trump now loves crypto: CNN's Harry Enten runs the numbers,cnn,USwcyA7B05w,"Shortly . This morning , Vice President J.D. Vance will speak at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas . The president 's sons , Don Jr and Eric , will also attend this event . The president and his family stepping ever deeper into the crypto world . CNN chief data analyst Harry Enten is here . , this segment will be titled how Donald Trump and his family learned to love crypto , , both politically and financially here . Let 's talk about , in general , the politics of crypto . How is it changed over the last ten years ? , this is one of the trend lines in American politics and just American society overall that makes you go , , crypto has become part of the mainstream . What are we talking about here ? The belief that crypto should be legal . Back in 2014 , it was just 38 % of Americans . Look at this shift . . It is now 55 % of Americans who believe that crypto should be legal , compared to just 38 % who believe it should in fact be illegal . At least most of the time . So this is a big part that 's playing into Donald Trump 's play here , is that the American public has shifted tremendously on it , going from just 38 % who believe it should be legal to now , 55 % who believe it should be legal in 2025 . All , crypto people , how have their politics changed ? . How have crypto people ? Part of this is Trump loves people who are loyal to him . . This is something we 've seen time and time again . Trump 's margin among crypto voters compared to overall in 2020 . He did four points worse among crypto voters than he did overall . He lost them . But take a look at 2024 . . That 's a huge shift . He did 19 points better among crypto voters than he did overall , won them rather easily . Saw part of Donald Trump getting into bed with crypto owners is that they Donald Trump , and therefore Donald Trump loves crypto owners . It 's possible that he saw fertile ground there , which is , he went in , he asked for their vote . He got he told them what he wanted to hear . How is he doing in crypto beyond politics ? . . So , , he spoke about the fact that the American public believes that crypto should be legal . We 've spoken about the fact that crypto voters have been loyal , have shifted over to Donald Trump . But it 's also that Donald Trump 's family is making a ton of money on crypto . Trump family paper gains from crypto get this nearing $ 1 billion . We 're talking from mining . We 're talking from their own coins . The bottom line is the Trump family saw an opportunity to go into crypto to make a lot of money from crypto , and that is , in fact , exactly what they have done . And Donald Trump is one of the people who has been responsible for bringing crypto into the mainstream because it 's been good for him politically , but it has also been quite good for him and his family financially . . Sometimes it is hard to find that line between those two . . All . Sometimes a little confusing . But Donald Trump is toeing that line . Or not . Or not . Harry Enten , thank you very much In the coming hours , U.S. Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to give a keynote address at the 2025 Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas . Donald Trump Jr has also appeared at the three day event , along with several U.S. lawmakers . Their appearances come amid a notable rollback of regulations in the cryptocurrency industry since President Trump started his second term in office . While speaking at the conference , the president 's oldest son said that he believes his father has always been a trailblazer . And once we started explaining to him the potential , as , , he 's a quick study as a guy who is a serious innovator . , , he did things before everyone else . He saw ideas before everyone else . He implemented them . And the first guy to do branded real estate , he was really successful in that . And he saw an opportunity in television , parlayed that into the presidency of the United States . , he 's a guy that gets these things . Meantime , the Trump Media and Technology group has announced plans to raise $ 2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin . That would be one of the largest bitcoin treasury deals of any public company . Joining me now is Adam Zarazinski , CEO of Inca Digital . That 's an analytics firm specializing in open source data and intelligence . Adam , great to have you this morning . to the program . Just first , your reaction to this news that Trump Media is raising $ 2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin . That 's a lot of money . How significant is that for the industry ? good morning and thanks for your time . , I think it 's significant . Of course , ultimately , I think all of these moves by the Trump administration are a good thing for America . , I , I and many other people in the crypto industry who see this , as a national security issue , something it 's a it 's it 's a new critical infrastructure for , for the world and for the United States in particular . And , the Trump admin leaning into crypto is ultimately going to be a good thing . And Bitcoin has more recently been near record highs . But it was n't long ago that it was the crypto winter was a very different , landscape . Then , Trump has said that he would to make the U.S the crypto capital of the world . Adam , where do the U.S. in this space three and a half years from now or at the end of his term ? . , now we are very behind . , we 're losing to Asia . we 're losing to the Gulf . We 're losing to China . and I and I think it 's important that we onshore as , as much crypto innovation as we can . and that 's that 's everything from , , , small data analytics companies mine , to more of the big exchanges , it 's important for our markets , in a lot of different ways , , to ensure efficiency , to , to , to bring innovation back here . It 's also important for law enforcement and for national security , ? If we have these companies here onshore , we are able to not just impute our , our jurisdiction , whether that 's , , what , the FBI or the national security community , but also just our values , . And and what we as Americans think markets should be . there 's no there 's no going back . It 's either it 's either going to be here or it 's going to be elsewhere . so I hope it 's going to be here . I know that 's a long winded answer to your question , but in the next three years , I , , I really hope that , that US markets , turn on to , to crypto in the way that I think they should and the way that you 're I think you 're starting to see , in the ecosystem . And so what would need to happen . You touched on it there in terms of law enforcement , law enforcement , what would need to happen from a regulatory standpoint point a policy standpoint in order for the U.S to catch up ? As you point out ? , , the first the first is just bringing companies onshore , ? still , most of the lit trading volume in crypto is offshore , despite Coinbase being a very large exchange . so , so that is step one . step two , while it one , I 'm not a policy wonk . , I think clear guidelines on what is expected of crypto companies here in the United States , is super important and is something that I know the administration is working on . , I had a I had a chat with Treasury officials just last week where they were getting input from a lot of the big crypto companies on what they need to get clear guidance , what that guidance should be . those are those are the two main things , that will really help . , crypto companies , come back to the U.S and grow here . . At the same time , you have , to your point , these , these , valid interests of at least , at least those in the industry of wanting to , onshore or , or make the U.S , more of a player in the crypto space at the on the other side , you have these concerns about how the administration , how trump how his family may be , benefiting from some of these ventures into crypto . And I 'm curious what the what their perspective has been inside of the crypto circles about Trump , his family , these ventures and how they impact , I think , the credibility or the legitimacy of the industry . . , , it 's it 's a mixed bag . I think for the most part , I 'm not I 'm not speaking for everybody . , the feeling is that it 's , it 's it 's demonizing what the Trump admin and what the Trump family is doing because it 's crypto . ? I 'm not sure how different it is than , , selling merchandise , , selling MAGA hats , for example , and benefiting off of that in some way , shape or form , or , Hunter Biden selling art pieces , ? I think , I think that the general sentiment is , is , is , is in the direction , , which is , , there 's this there 's a sentiment in the United States that we do n't want public officials benefiting off of their personas and personalities . . But it 's happening everywhere . And this is just this is an example of it . , of it be happening in crypto . but whether that , , whether it 's congressmen trading , trading off of private information , , that they have the ability to trade stocks or selling art or selling merch , . And , and doing marketing . And I think the sentiment is . but , , overwhelmingly at least , , in the crypto community , Trump 's involvement is seen as a good thing . And as a sign that , there 's that there are good markets ahead and there 's going to be more innovation here in the US . . , to be fair , I think there was quite a bit of concern about all those other issues that you pointed out to , whether it is merch or whether it 's art . . , they raised flags and questions as well about , , any ethical considerations that need to be , raised . But all important talking points . Great to have you this morning . That 's Adam Zarazinski Thank you sir . Thank you so much . All ."

I saw the tearful testimony from a former employee who 'd spent years in his inner c She claims that he kidnaped her and threatened to kill her . Just a moment . My team of legal experts and court insiders will go throu what we heard from Capricorn . Cl Now , her testimony is critically important to the prosecution because her job put her inside the core of Diddy 's business emp Now , Clark testified that she was kidnaped . Her words when Diddy found out that Cassie Ventura was dating Kid Cu She also told the jury today about the multiple times that he had threatened her own l including during her very first day on the job . And she said that daddy had final approval over every aspect of Cassie 's ca Now Clark , she worked for Diddy on and off for more than a decade , starting first as a personal assistant in 2004 and what she alleges happened in December of 2011 . Maybe the most shocking . That 's when Diddy discovered that Cassie was in a relationshi of some kind with Kid Cudi . She said that Diddy banged on he around 6:00 in the morning , holding a gun and furious she did n't tell him about Cassie and Cutty . Clark dressed to the jury . He just said , get dressed , we 're going to kill this N - word . And when she tried to protest , she said , Diddy told her , I do n't give an f what you want Go get dressed . Now , Clark said that she was the swept into a Cadillac Escalade . They drove to Kid Cuddy 's home , and she claimed that Diddy and one of his security guards then went inside the house . Clark frantically called Cassie to tell her what was happening . Happening . Testifying that a short time later , Cuddy 's car pulled up nex and then took off during , the security guard jump back in the Escalade . Then she described a short car chase before Katy got away . After it was all over . Clark said Diddy gave her an ult she and Cassie needed to sway ki against telling the cops , but Diddy was involved in the alleged break in . Clark testified , , he says if do n't convin of that , I 'll kill all you members . But that was n't the only time that Clark said that she feared for her own life She claimed that he once accused her of stealing diamond jewelry , so that she suffered through fiv straight days of lie detector test inside of a gutted , rundown Manhattan office building . She testified the man giving the tests warned her , quo I 'm not getting a good reading . You need to calm down . You 're going to be in the East R If I ca n't get a reading on this Clark even said that Diddy threa on her very first day working for him , testifying that it 's because she worked at night record label before working for Diddy . She claimed he took her to Central Park with his bodyguard . It happened . He told me he did n't know that I had anything to do with ignite and if anything happened , he would have to kill me . Clark also testified about Diddy control over Cassie Ventura , saying that he had final approva on everything from Cassie 's hair and makeup to the projects she was working on . And again with the Wag Meister , who saw all of the testimony in court today . It was quite a day . She testified very emotionally , by the way , for a long period of time , and it was about a very dark parting message that she spoke about today , when Diddy fired her in 2012 , what did she say happened ? . So , Capricorn Clark did n't just testify to what she alleged happened while she was working for Diddy . She also testified and told the jury that after she was terminated , that he essentially blacklisted from the industry . I want to read you part of what on the stand . She said , , that he said that I would never work again , that he would show me that all these people were n't my and he would make me kill myself So she testified jury that she w and he had the power and the trouble over her career . She said that her home at the ti was paid for by the company . Her car was paid for by the comp All these things went away when she was terminated and she had trouble getting anot She was breaking down in sobs th , it almost was she was on the edge of always crying , and she did throughout her entire testimony , but was when she talked about asking for Shawn 's forgive that she really got emotional . What happened ? . So the defense , during their cross - examination , they brought up a series of emai and text messages showing that Capricorn Clark stayed in communication with Sean Combs even after she was terminated as recently as 2021 , that she in communication with him as recently as 2024 , that she had met with him . Now , she explained this because she said he had all the and she had nothing . And again , remember she used that word blacklisted . So her explanation was I had to I had to put food on the table . She said that she has a son with autism who is non - verbal . She has to provide for him . And she felt that the only way to continue to work in this indu was to stay in Diddy 's good grac because she did say that she went to a few other companie for what she thought were job interviews or meetings , and that she realized that she was blacklisted because she thought her prospect that Diddy badmouthed her in the industry . She went for interviews , they returned with warnings and apparently a lot to unpack it , go over the I want to talk to some of our great legal minds who are here as well . To break this all down , we 've got CNN legal analyst and of course , criminal defense Joey Jackson is in the building Also , we have the former Westche D.A. , Mimi Rodger and former Manhattan pros Jeremy Salmond . There is a lot to unpack today . First of all , she was really emotional throughout the entire day . I can not overstate that enough . She was on the verge of tears throughout at sometimes holding her head in her hands , taking off her glasses just to emote even more . I do n't mean emote in the way that I did n't believe her , but she was really emotional . I want to begin with you , Jeremy because now we are in week three ? I want to try to reset and remind our viewers about the charges here . You 've got Rico . You 've got sex trafficking , you 've got prostitution . All important . Let 's start with Rico racketeeri Essentially . First up , you got the predicate How does this move the needle towards the prosecuti Proving Rico does it ? I do n't think they have until re And I think it starts in part in large part with Capricorn . But they moved it until Magnific did a good job a little bit , moving it back , because you need that predicate and he will go with kidnaping to translate that . What that means is predicate act What does that mean ? And so the underlying crime that 's part of this . You need more than one that helps build the structure for this criminal enterprise . And this is where they were goin And here you have the kidnaping as a piece of this in furtherance , not a on But in furtherance of this I 'll use the criminal conspiracy And what she says is and one point is that , , she gets into the car and she 's forced to the car and I think she claims that she also told Cassie and Co on the one in the call that there was a gun , but they did n't say anything about the gun . She says something about how she went along , possibly to make sure everything was , and did even get into further trouble and substance . He was cross - examined by Mark Nicolo on that point . then , what you really taken there against h you need to establish these pred acts again . We 're going to go with kidnaping Otherwise you ca n't get that Ric or conspiracy to Rico charge . Do they move the ball ? They had to get there because they have n't gotten ther Did they do enough ? Not yet . So we 're 17 witnesses in . We 're still on the predicate par And of course , the jurors are not hearing every single day This is the predicate part of the government 's case . But they got to prove the predic But the word enterprise is going to be top of mind for them as well . They have to show that there is an enterprise itself . And they , of course , have now an inner part of the circle in terms of this one in Capricor Now , she says , Mimi , that security guards ran lie detector test . She did n't know who everyone was involved , that they were going to throw he in the East River over allegations that she stole from Jacob the je there was mob terms the East River on that . Does that , in and of itself conf that there was an inner circle that was an enterprise ? , I think we 're getting ther and I think they 've started to put in the building blocks fo It was n't the first piece . The first piece obviously work through the first few witnesses was establishing , the sex trafficking and the coercion through , Cassie and then corroborating witnesses I think now what we 've started t is how Combs used employees of his business , of his business to , there was a legitimate business , but then these employees were be or told to do illegitimate things as wel which is that you could have a legitimate busi doing illegitimate acts . And so fine does n't have to be a fake e . Or just that the people doing it may have legitimate jobs , be employees receive , salaries f but they 're also doing other thi for this purpose , which here is alleged to be essentially the , satisfact of combs , his desires , his needs his , self esteem , his power , his It 's it 's going , we have a ways more to g And this is one of those cases that I think is very much going to come down to closing ar and how the government brings all of that together to explain the enterprise to the And I think they 'll do a very good job here . But I think they 're putting in the building blocks that ."

And really bad . That 's an all caps he 's playing with fire . That fire might come in the form of new sanctions , according to sources talking to Joining us now , CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger of The New York Tim He also wrote the book New Cold War Is China 's Rise , Russia 's Invasion and America 's Struggle to Defend the West . David , thanks for joining us . What bad things is President Trump talking about that would have happened to Russia had it not been for  And , , it 's really hard , maybe he is thinking tha the United States would continue to support , Ukraine and send more , arms and ammunition , air defenses . though I think Congress probably had pretty much at its fill of that . Jake . certainly there would have been more sanct and perhaps the $ 300 billion that the Russians inexplicably left in European banks would now be in the hands of Ukr But the fact of the matter is , J he keeps saying we 're going to be sanctions is this and that , but he has really done anything that would hurt Vladimir Putin in the slightest . In fact , he all but exempted him from the from the tariffs . You have Liberation Day tariffs . Do you think that there is any amount of sanctions that would prompt Putin to stop It 's pretty hard to imagine that first of all , this is , in Putin 's mind , pretty existential . He 's lost , , huge number of people , up to a million by some estimate maybe a bit fewer , who are both wounded or dead . it 's a point now where there are n't that many more sanctions the West can put on Russia . , even in the best of days there was n't much we bought from the only thing that could really them is if the US and the Europeans were able to c the purchases of Russian oil and that China and India are making . And I 'm not sure that President Trump 's willing to go do that . You wrote , an analysis about Trump 's exaspe message on Sunday when Trump said that Putin has , , gone absolutely crazy . Trump has historically shown great deference to Putin . You say , , missing from Mr. Trump 's zigzags is an explanation of why he has been unable to use his relationship with Mr. Putin to persuade him to halt the violence , even for a ceasefire , unquote . Why do you think , David , why do you think Trump has not been able to leverage his relationship with Putin ? , you may remember , Jake , that back during the campaign and even during the Obama administration , in the run up to President Trump first campaign , he said Vladimir Putin does n't r Obama or Biden , and he respected Trump and therefore , that 's why this could get solved in 24 hour he discovered that he had a two hour conversation with Vladimir Putin last Monday . And the result this weekend was the biggest air attack on Ky and other parts of Ukraine that we 've seen during three years of war , mostly aimed at civilians . So , clearly he has overestimated what his influence on Vladimir P And you 're seeing that in the ki frustrated , tweets he 's sending And in his comments to reporters But the question is , what is he willing to back that , I totally on this crazy ch when Trump said that Putin has g absolutely crazy . Let 's dive into that for one sec because , Putin has long wanted to Russia to flex its mus He 's long thought the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest disaster in the history of the 20th centu He said that . But there is this craziness ques In 2022 , after the invasion of U I spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron about why about and why he started this war . Macron talked about those two other elements that I just mentioned . but he also talked about and he also talked about the lack of respect that he thinks Russia gets from the world . But he also talked about this other thing about his psyche . Take a listen . I would say this is a post - COVID consequence isolation because he 's so isolat I think so , I think so post - Covid 19 , there was the totally new situat So he had a window of opportunit and he decided to completely break the linearity of , of this and go to the war . It sounds good when he says it with his French but he 's saying that Putin went a little nuts during and Covid . And I 've heard that from a number of world leaders . What about you ? , I 've heard the same thing . and , I would n't be surprised if that 's the case , but there 's also nothing in Vlad Putin 's recent behavior accelerating the war while talking about how he 'd be willing to do a ceas under the following nine conditi That 's inconsistent with things that he has done , , at least since the invasion of Crimea in which also seemed crazy to us . . So , , the president being surprised that Vladimir Putin is acting as a brutish , authoritarian who 's invading a n country . we 're a bordering country . , there 's not a whole lot new there . We are horrified by seeing what Russia 's doing . But were you really surprised ? you 've covered Trump over many for many years . Trump and Putin , his handling of What do you what 's your takeaway with this uptick in rhetoric ? And will that uptick in rhetoric be met with action ? I 'm not sure it means a thing other than he has a reason to use a lot of capital letters n Freezie . And he likes to do that Not not just bad , but really bad in capital letter Look , when I talk to national security and State Department folks , the Kremlin , let 's face it , does n't seem worried . Vladimir Putin seems to feel very confident that he 's holding all the cards . A couple of weeks ago , someone compared it to Lucy and Charlie Brown and the football with Lucy being So , look , we 're hearing about sa We 're seeing these posts . Vladimir Putin does not seem to want to change what he 's doing in Ukraine . And until he does , I 'm not sure these posts mean much of anything , but there is this bipartisan pre that is now growing for more sanctions , as you 're referring to . there 's this bill that the Senator Lindsey Graham has with Senator Richard Blumenthal in the Senate It has more than 80 co - sponsors . And there 's a push for a vote on essentially , snap in sanctions , primary and secondary sanctions could be significant . This is what Senator Grassley , Chuck Grassley , the longest serving Republican senator , said he said in two posts on ABC he said , I believe President Trump was sincere when he thought his friendship with Putin would end the war . Now that being the case , it 's time for sanctions . Strong enough so Putin knows . Game over . He went on to say in a second tweet today , President Trump should take the decisive action against Putin that he takes against Harvard sa for Putin , no fed grants for Harvard . Has Chuck Grassley famous shorthand on ex but nevertheless less , will Trump act facing these calls from Republic I think the president 's very clearly frustrated with Vladimir Putin . And we have to remember that Russia has one product that they sell oil and gas produ mostly to Europe and Asia . And so a round of sanctions can hit Rus pretty quickly and hurt them pretty badly . They ca n't make money if oil drops to $ 50 a barrel . that 's Putin begins to bleed muscle at that point . So I think Trump will probably consider san because he 's clearly decided that his previous approach is not getting where you want to I think it 's worth noting this is essentially the Biden administration 's appro to this conflict , one that , Trump , , pilloried on the campa trail , said that he would come i one and would be able to end the conflict , even criticized sanctions at the He did absolutely . And now he 's sitting in the sitting on sancti But now he 's sitting in the seat we 're making have where he 's having to deal with the reality of the tough de And his policy is looking a whol what the Biden administration tried t So , , I think it 's also interesting you talk about Republicans and , , Grassley , we know a lot of Republicans who had a lot of misgiving about Trump 's approach to , to the conflict in Russia and Ukraine , were absolutely willing to say on the campaign trail , , that they were fine with where Trump was going . And , , now there 's a lit I think there 's a reckoning here that they 're having to deal with What are your sources saying ? , I think one of the big things to this is personal for President T , he has prided himself in part of the brand around Trump is the art of the deal . , that is something I still consistently hear . Suppo Just a few weeks ago , I was in Bucks County , Pennsylvania , swing area and talking to folks who voted f Part of what they want to see is him really cutting deals , making things happen , whether that 's on tariffs and trade or that 's on Ukraine . , that is something that he again , has touted is part of the persona . So this chips away at that . If he is not able to deliver on some progress , on some movement on this"
https://youtu.be/HFalaBcSxUc?si=rQT-blQdyBrN4omw,Trump: Putin 'playing with fire' with escalating attacks on Ukraine,cnn,HFalaBcSxUc,"President Trump is lashing out at Vladimir Putin again today while issuing new threats against the Kremlin . Just moments ago , in a social media post , he wrote What Putin does n't realize is that if it were n't for me , lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia , and really bad . He 's playing with fire . Sources tell CNN the president is now considering new sanctions on Moscow , as he grows more frustrated over the Kremlin 's escalating attacks on Ukraine . This is happening after another wave of Russian strikes overnight . They pounded numerous parts of the country , and Ukrainian officials say at least two people were killed and 16 were wounded . In the meantime , Moscow is blasting a decision by Germany and other Ukrainian allies , including the U.S. , to lift a ban on firing long range missiles into Russia . That 's a move that allows Ukraine to strike military targets that are much deeper inside of Russia . It 's a decision that the Kremlin is calling dangerous . CNN 's Alayna Treene is with us now from the White House . Alayna , what are you learning about Trump 's growing frustration with Putin ? , it 's clear , Brianna , there really has been a shift in tone and rhetoric and also just a private frustrations that the president is feeling when it relates to and specifically Russian President Vladimir Putin . Look , I think it 's clear that the president has so far been hesitant to put any sanctions and pressure of sanctions and economic pressure really , on Russia through this entire process , because privately , he 's noted that he believes that doing so could push Russia farther away from the negotiating table . Thus far , he 's really been trying to do as much as he can to fulfill his campaign promise of bringing both Russia and Ukraine together to find some off ramp to this war and ultimately , a ceasefire . But increasingly , both he and his closest advisers are recognizing that perhaps Putin is not necessarily living up to what he 's been telling Trump behind closed doors , and people are growing increasingly unsure of whether or not he 's ready to strike some deal to end this war with Ukraine . Because of that , we 're learning now behind the scenes that he is considering potentially wanting to place sanctions on Russia and try to up the ante with them and show President Putin that he 's very serious about this . Of course , this comes as we know that many of the United States European allies , and even some people here in the United States , people Senator Lindsey Graham , have really been pressuring and trying to influence this administration to do just that , to put sanctions on Russia and try to force their hand . Now , I do think it 's very interesting to see how the president has been talking about these most recent attacks from Russia on Ukraine , because the way that the president put it , particularly in that TruthSocial post today , when he said Putin does n't realize that if it were n't for me , lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia . He said that he thinks Putin has gone crazy . He said that this weekend in a separate post . , it 's clear that the president is starting to lose patience with Russia . And I know from my conversations with several Trump administration officials that he really did believe that he would be able to make more progress at this point to so many months now into his second term . And so really , I think the next few days are going to be pretty critical to learning whether or not the president is going to move forward and try to put this pressure of sanctions on Russia , or if he 'll continue to wait and see if he can still try to get any deal with both of these countries to come together for an ultimate ceasefire . Brianna . Alayna Treene , live for us at the White House . Thank you . Boris ? Let 's talk about these latest developments with retired General Wesley Clark . He 's a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander . General Clark , great to see you , as always with these stepped up attacks over recent days , what would you say is Russia 's immediate objective on the battlefield ? Russia 's main objective is to continue to pressure , try to break the government of Ukraine , break the will of the people , to continue to resist . At the same time , it 's pushing very hard in the north , in the center . And the ultimate objective , of course , is in the south to sweep across the coast of the Black Sea and take Odessa . And that 's what their objective would be for , let 's say , September , October . If they are successful in breaking through Ukrainian lines and drawing off the reserves into the north . What would you say are the practical implications of having Germany and other Ukrainian allies lift these restrictions on Kyiv to fire long range missiles into Russia for the first time ? Could that slow down the Russian advance ? I think the lifting of the restrictions is an important signal psychologically . I think it 's also marginally important , provided the United States is providing the intelligence to accurately target these long range strikes . How many they are , what the inventory is and what the impact . It remains to be seen . But there is a way to make a greater impact is to surge more U.S. artillery in small arms and the other items that Ukraine desperately needs now . The administration so far has floated the idea of additional sanctions , and there is a bipartisan bill in the Senate proposing a 500 % tariff on any country that is buying Russian energy now . Do that , financial disincentive as enough to sway Vladimir Putin toward the negotiating table ? Seems unlikely that a tariff can go in and go in effectively against countries India and Gulf states who are involved in , directly or indirectly in the Russian oil trade . But it 's an important step , and it 's very important for the president at this point . After 5 to 6 weeks of expressing frustration and threatening sanctions to move ahead and do something . So whether it 's that particular set of sanctions or something else , it 's very important at this time that he take concrete action . This is not going to harm the prospect of negotiations . It 's going to incentivize them . You mentioned bolstering Ukraine 's ability to defend itself . I wonder when you hear that Ukraine 's air defenses overnight intercepted 43 Russian drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles . what is Ukraine 's current aerial defense capacity ? How long can they sustain that defense before needing extra ammunition ? , they need it . They need it now . First of all , they need additional Patriot missiles , and they need a couple of more Patriot batteries to go in , to protect . But what 's happening is the Russian drones are getting more sophisticated . They 're sending in decoy drones . They assure heeds are flying higher . they have , different guidance systems . So they 're not as easily jammed . so , so all of this demands a response by Ukraine ? Some of the responses of a different artillery systems , directed against the drones , using the F-16s and other aircraft more effectively against the drones , more Patriot and other , anti - aircraft missile systems from our allies can be sent out . But the point is , it 's a dynamic battlefield , and Mr. Putin has n't slacked off . He 's doing everything he can , I think , to intensify this while at the same time , posturing forces to be prepared to go into , Belarus , through Belarus and into Lithuania , or , northeast Poland , by autumn . That 's the threat . General Wesley Clark . always great to get your point of view . Thanks for joining us . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/wBVdrK1jrBM?si=hcFO0zjpZft0Ih-F,"FBI deputy director: Bureau to further investigate cocaine found at WH, Dobbs leak, DC pipe bomb",cnn,wBVdrK1jrBM,"The FBI is stepping up efforts to investigate several very high profile cases from just before and during the Biden era , Deputy Director Dan Bongino says the bureau is now doubling down on and pushing more resources to solve cases of what he calls . And I 'm quoting him now , potential public corruption . CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez is here with us in the Situation Room of in one of these cases involves pipe bombs found near the DNC and RNC headquarters on the day before the January 6th insurrection up on Capitol Hill . What more can you tell us ? , Wolf , of these pipe bombs were found . They were found on the morning of January 6th , and it diverted resources , law enforcement resources . If you recall that morning over to the RNC and the DNC , which obviously coincided with the beginning of the riot , that attack of the mob , that attack the I 'm sorry , the U.S. Capitol . And that 's one of the reasons why there 's been a lot of conspiracy and a lot of conjecture about exactly who did this . I 'll read you just a part of what the Bongino , social media post said . He said the director and I evaluated a number of cases of potential public corruption that understandably have garnered public interest . We made this decision to either reopen or push additional resources and investigative attention to these cases . And then he mentioned the pipe bomb case . Obviously . and a couple of others . Now , the question here , though , Wolf , is , , what new things could the FBI be doing ? We know . And you and I have talked about the pipe bomb investigations . We 've seen them pour in a lot of resources . They 've made over a thousand interviews to try to find the person who to place these bombs there the night before . And so far they have not been able to break this case open , perhaps a new set of eyes could finally find the suspect who placed those bombs there , Wolf . And what can you tell us about the other two cases that the FBI deputy director Dan Bongino , wants to reopen ? . , there 's one of them . Is the Dobbs decision , the leak of the Dobbs decision , essentially , the , what was the draft of what became the decision from the US Supreme Court that overturned Roe v Wade and the rights of women to have abortions in this country . The second one is , the finding of a small bag of cocaine containing cocaine in a cubby , inside the White House . And both of those were looked at . The Secret Service could not find who placed , that who had cocaine in the office there in this section , which had a lot of public access , including , construction workers and others , they could never find it . And , of course , the Dobbs decision , of course , in the end , was verified to be under the draft was accurate . What 's interesting about that , Wolf , is whether the Supreme Court , which is a separate branch , will allow the FBI to come in and say , do interviews with the with the justices . That would be an extraordinary step . It would . Be alright . I 'm impressed . Thank you very , very much . There 's more news we 're following . But first I want to bring in CNN senior law enforcement analyst , former FBI Deputy director Andrew McCabe . Andrew , what do you make of this announcement from the Deputy Director of the FBI to reopen some of these cases ? , Wolf , it 's a it 's a little bit concerning , I 'll be honest with you . It 's , it raises some questions about what the Deputy Director 's understanding of public corruption is . as we know , public corruption under federal law is when someone who 's in a position of trust , takes something of value in return for executing an official duty . So it 's almost impossible for me to understand how these three scenarios conform with that federal criminal violation , unless he 's suggesting that the investigators , which would be the FBI in terms of the pipe bomb case , or maybe the Secret Service in terms of the cocaine in the White House case , had somehow intentionally not done their jobs and reached no conclusion in those cases for some corrupt purpose . I ca n't even imagine what that would be . It 's a pretty serious allegation to make against his own people and , people of a neighboring , partner agency . But , I guess we 'll see how it all plays out . I just want a follow up on that . Are those the cases that the FBI would normally look into and reopen in a situation this ? Not at all . So in the case of the bombing , that is one that is I would expect is still under active investigation . And it 's always good with a case that 's gone a bit cold to bring in new eyes , to do some a review , maybe to contribute additional resources . But again , there 's no obvious public corruption angle there . The other two cases are not even really FBI matters . The cocaine in the White House would have been investigated by the Secret Service . We know that they conducted investigation . They reviewed , they said hundreds of people had been in that area during that day , and it was impossible to figure out who had left the cocaine there . As far as the Supreme Court case goes , that was investigate by the by officials within the Supreme Court , as Evan pointed out . That is a separate branch of government . That 's the judiciary . The absolute pinnacle of the judicial branch . They conducted an investigation and ultimately determined that they could n't identify after having looked at the computer network , all the things that documents that have been accessed and printed out . They could n't determine who was responsible for . That 's really not an FBI matter at all . The FBI investigates leak cases , but only when those cases implicate national security . That 's clearly not the case here . So I 'm not sure what the f the FBI director would be predicting an investigation of that violation of Supreme Court policy on . I think it 's true that these cases have drawn a lot of attention , especially in conservative media . Are you concerned at all , Andrew , that they 're now becoming politicized ? Very much so . Very much so . We know that this administration makes a lot of their decisions about what to do day to day , based on what they 're seeing in the news cycle . And that 's really what this feels . As I said , it 's not there . There are no obvious political corruption connections here from our perspective . But that 's seems to be the flag that the deputy director is waving . That 's one that 's always greeted with some , , received very positively and wing media . and so and it 's also coming at a time when there 's not a lot of good FBI news coming out about leadership decisions . We learned last week they 're they 're forcing all agents to spend 30 % of their time doing immigration work , which has never been the case in the FBI . They are eliminating the , white collar crime program , leaving the nation bereft of professional investigators to hold corporate malfeasance to account . so there 's a lot of really questionable decisions going on there , and this feels a lot a convenient distraction . Interesting . All . Andrew McCabe , thank you very , very much ."

A decision the Kremlin has called dangerous . Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously threatened war with NATO if long range weapons supplied by the West were used against Russia . This follows , of course , a weekend of massive Russian drone and missile strikes across Ukraine that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to say that Putin had , , gone crazy . Chancellor merkel , meantime , is hoping President Trump 's words could possibly lead to some concrete action on the ice . He was sworn into office . Trump is obviously increasingly disillusioned with Putin due to the massive attacks on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the weekend . In this respect , I hope that America stays on board the power of the US Aussie . The question is whether the USA will continue to see it as its political and military duty to help Ukraine . And that is what we are trying to achieve . In the latest round of attacks , Russia hit the Sumy and Donetsk regions , killing at least two people . CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Lake and tweeting out from Washington . Colonel Layton , good to see you . Those comments from Donald Trump , of course , where he said he thought that Putin had changed . This is not the Putin that he knows . He 's known him for some time . there was some head scratching over those comments because to most , this was a Vladimir Putin that had been here all along . As we watch the fallout from these comments . What is the impact , do you think , on the war itself ? , good to be with you , Erica . . I think the impact on the war is going to be multifaceted . One aspect of this is that this is the Trump realization , I guess we 'll call it that . Putin is doing evil things . At least his partial realization , may very well pave the way for further , use of U.S. aid , in , in this war , however , it could branch off into another way where , Trump will wash his hands of everything . So the German chancellor 's comments , become , I think , quite interesting in the sense that he is definitely looking for the US to continue its support . The Europeans are trying very hard to step up , but they are , also counting on the US to do , its share , in essence , to maintain some of the , weapons deliveries and ammunitions deliveries and intelligence support , that the US has provided in the past . So it could very well , , in one sense , it could do it , , make the war more , survivable , if you will , for the Ukrainians . on the other hand , it could also draw eventually draw the Russians closer to the negotiating table . And that , of course , is the hope of Chancellor Morrison and others who he does . And it was an interesting purchase on the part of the Chancellor talking about the US duty there , and how the U.S. would choose to follow that . It 's also , as we watch what has been this really intensifying on the part of , of Russia in terms of attacks over the last several days . Do this as Russia trying to maybe see how far it can push Donald Trump in some ways ? , I think that is part of it . Erica , one of one aspect of this , , could be from a military perspective that they 're in essence , trying to soften up , Ukrainian targets for a summer offensive that a lot of us think will happen , that the Russians will try to engage in . but , the Russians are clearly testing Trump . they 're clearly testing the West . They 've been doing that really since the beginning of this phase of the conflict . And it seems to me that they are going to continue to , to do this as much as they can . That one possible outcome of this is that the Russians will more quickly deplete , their , their weapons as they , , do these , conduct these attacks ? but on the other side of that is the fact that the Russians have made their economy a wartime economy and increased their production capacity substantially . So , if there are any , diminution in the , ability of the Russians to conduct attacks this , I think they might be short lived . as we look at how this is playing out , the fact that , , Chancellor Mertz is talking about the Ukraine can not defend itself using these long range missiles to fire into Russia . the Kremlin responding , calling this dangerous . And then I thought it was interesting that said , , this has been the case for months . The fact that it 's being said out loud , though , what does that change ? , I think Mertz is , , in some ways , he 's at least publicly distancing himself with what his predecessor , chancellor , former Chancellor Olaf Scholz , did . Schultz was very clear that , , at least in his public pronouncements that , German weapons could not be used for long range attacks into Russia . but to the new policy under , Chancellor Merkel is that , in essence , the Germans are mirroring what do the French , the British and the US , have done in the past with systems the Storm Shadow and , the attack on , Himars missile systems so that brings the Germans up to the same standard , if you will . another question remains , will the Germans provide one of their weapon systems , which would be extremely useful for the Ukrainians , and that would be the tourist missile , if they provide the Taurus , that could be , a potential game changer , at least in the short run for the Ukrainians . And the Ukrainians would certainly welcome that . Colonel Cedric Layton , always appreciate your insight . Thank you . With us now CNN Global Affairs analyst Kim Dozier . So , so these restrictions , which the German chancellor is talking about in weapons that were given to Ukraine by the United States and allies for a long time , and President Biden wanted this to want to restrictions , did n't want Ukraine to be able to shoot them deep into Russia or wherever they wanted . Now , the German chancellor says , have at it . What difference could that make ? . Doing this in defiance or without seeking the permission of the Trump administration , this means that they can use these weapons . The Ukrainians can hit Russian supply lines , Russian command and control nodes , the same things that the Russians are doing to the Ukrainians . It levels the playing field somewhat , but what they really need is permission to do the same thing with all the U.S. directly supplied weaponry , and they need continuing supplies to be able to continue to prosecute the fight , as Russian troops are apparently readying for a summer offensive . And whether those supplies continue in the numbers that they have for the last year . That 's one of the major questions now facing Ukraine , really facing the world . President Trump expressed surprise over the weekend that Vladimir Putin in Russia continues to attack Ukraine . What does that tell you if he 's really surprised ? What does that tell you ? That every time Putin talks to him , as he did last week in a long two hour plus conversation , Putin manages to convince Trump that he is taking some steps towards negotiation , towards a cease fire . The Kremlin has said that they 're about to come out with a memo that Putin promised Trump last week on how they would go forward with a cease fire , but it keeps not happening . And Trump 's tweet over the weekend got dismissed by the Kremlin as emotional . . When you talk to Ukrainians and Europeans about this , they 're , when is he going to get it that Putin is playing him ? Is he afraid of Putin ? He seems to be as risk averse as Biden was fearful that Putin might use nuclear weapons . And President Trump is said to be considering new sanctions against Russia . Nothing definite at this point would how much would new sanctions make a difference ? The sanctions would be symbolic but important for morale on the ground in Ukraine . They would be doing things the Senator Lindsey Graham . A package that 's being considered on Capitol Hill would hit China , India and the EU for buying oil , gas and uranium from Russia . So that would stop some of the money that 's keeping the Russian war machine going . But it 's not enough because at this point , the Russians have so increased their weapons production capacity that they 're storing weapons up to use in the future on the battlefield . And that 's bad news for Ukraine . It is ominous . All , Kim Dozier , thank you very much ."
https://youtu.be/yMFEMYHbSsU?si=paaVyUiS69S2T-nM,Hear Kremlin’s response to Trump calling Putin ‘crazy’,cnn,yMFEMYHbSsU,"The Kremlin is blaming emotional overload for Donald Trump 's critical comments about Vladimir Putin . After the US president called his Russian counterpart absolutely crazy . Trump 's remarks followed Russia 's largest ever aerial assault on Ukraine over the weekend . The Kremlin spokesperson sought to downplay the criticism and instead said Moscow is grateful to the US for help in launching the negotiation process with Ukraine . Great news , of course . At the same time , this is a very crucial moment , which is associated , of course , with the emotional overload of everyone . Absolutely , and with emotional reactions . We follow this very closely . German Chancellor Friedrich March said it 's clear Trump is increasingly disillusioned with Putin after the continued attacks on Ukraine . He also spoke about the lifting of range restrictions for weapons delivered to Ukraine by Germany and other Ukrainian allies , a move the Kremlin calls dangerous . CNN 's Kristen Holmes has more now from Washington . President Donald Trump having a clear change of public posture when it comes to Russia and Russia 's President Vladimir Putin , after his phone call with him last week , where he described the relationship as good , saying that Ukraine and Russia were going to go straight to the negotiating table . He is growing frustrated with the Russian president , particularly after that series of attacks we saw over the weekend . This is what he told reporters . I 'm not happy with what Putin is doing . He 's killing a lot of people and I do n't know what the hell happened to Putin . I 've known him a long time , always gotten along with him , but he 's sending rockets into cities and killing people , and I do n't it at all . , we 're in the middle of talking , and he 's shooting rockets into gear in other cities . I do n't it at all . Now , generally , Donald Trump spends most of his time talking about his good relationship with Vladimir Putin , focusing instead on the actual war in Ukraine , on trade deals or potential economic partnerships should Russia and the war . It was particularly interesting in this conversation with reporters , is that he was asked if he 's considering adding additional sanctions to Russia , and in this conversation he said because of what he is seeing going on in Ukraine . Last week , after that conversation between Putin and Trump , it seemed sanctions were all almost completely off the table , or at least additional sanctions . There . Now , the other thing I want to point out here is that Donald Trump continues to try and back away from this conflict . He once said that he would resolve in 24 hours in a series of posts over the weekend . He also said this was n't his problem . It was n't his war . He blamed it on Zelenskyy , on Putin , and even on Joe Biden . Kristen Holmes , CNN , the White House . Jill Dougherty is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University . She 's also a former CNN Moscow bureau chief and the author of My Russia What I Saw Inside the Kremlin . Appreciate you joining us . , Rosemary . Good to be here . Wonderful . So one day after President Donald Trump called Vladimir Putin absolutely crazy for targeting civilian planes in Russia 's biggest aerial attack since the start of the war , the Kremlin is now responding , saying Donald Trump may be suffering an emotional overload . So what does this signal to you , and how likely is it that Donald Trump will now respond by imposing additional sanctions on Russia to get Putin to the negotiating table ? , that coming up by Dmitry Peskov , the spokesperson for the president of Russia , was this is emotional for everyone . It is highly emotional . Emotional overload is the word that he used . So I think what they 're trying to do is , , it does n't look good for the president of the United States to call the president of Russia crazy . It does n't look good domestically for president Putin to be called crazy . So I think what they 're trying to do , they want to continue to talk with the United States . Putin apparently does n't want peace now at all , but they want to keep talking . So what they 're trying to do is smooth down , , the edges of this comments by President Trump and keep the ball rolling . But but , not create too many problems in the relationship at this point . And Jill , President Trump appears shocked that Putin is targeting civilians with a deadly aerial attack , shooting rockets into cave and other cities while in the middle of peace talks is what he observed . But most other world leaders already knew what Putin was capable of . Why did it take so long for Trump and his administration to realize who they 're dealing with ? , , it might be that there is a difference between his administration and the president himself , because the administration has , in some cases , sounded a little bit harder . But President Trump , , I believe , thought that he could get a deal with the power of his personality and that personal relationship with Vladimir Putin . It has n't happened . And it must be intensely frustrating . And you can hear it , , in the president 's comments , calling Putin crazy . He sounds angry and he sounds frustrated . But the question is , Rosemary , and you ask , is will he do anything about it ? Will he follow through on what he said ? I 'm , , open to considering , sanctions . But he did n't say what sanctions . And he said this before . He said it numerous times that , , he 's not happy . We should do this , etc . , but he has not pushed for new sanctions . And that 's that is the crux . And it could be sanctions . It could also be military aid for Ukraine . And he 's not doing that either . And meantime , European leaders , reaffirming their support for Ukraine and renewing ceasefire calls after Putin 's aerial assault on Ukraine and after Trump called Putin absolutely crazy . They are hoping that this signals that Washington will now take a harder line in pressuring Putin to the negotiating table . But as you 've pointed out , we 're not seeing any signs of that now . So what do you expect might happen next ? , you have the Europeans now , saying that the Ukrainians can use weapons that they get from the Europeans to attack Russia . , long range . That 's something that president , President Biden did not want to do . He was very concerned that would create even more problems and even lead to some type of war . But the Europeans are now apparently moving ahead on that . And the , Russian spokesperson , Dmitry Peskov said that could be dangerous . That would be a dangerous step . So I think the war now is , , continuing for force , in fact , perhaps even more for us . And before and then the peace negotiations always very hard to say what President Putin what , President Trump will do next . But he could still walk away . , there 's still that possibility , even though he continue , he threatens to walk away , but then he does n't . And he 's back in the game again . But he could walk away and finally say , look , , Putin 's crazy . . And he had criticism for Zelensky as well . Zelensky creates problems now every time he opens his mouth and therefore I am walking away . It 's almost as if he is talking to school children . There is that castigating tone , and we 'll just have to see where that leads . Jill Dougherty , many thanks for your analysis . Appreciate it ."
https://youtu.be/E1wLYOFfQ88?si=3o7uLSHKS-BWvAVw,‘Welcome to team democracy’: Ex-NATO commander applauds Trump for criticizing Putin,cnn,E1wLYOFfQ88,"President Trump says Vladimir Putin has gone absolutely crazy . The Kremlin says Trump is having a , , emotional overload . The rare rebukes between the two countries coming as Ukraine accuses Russia of carrying out the largest air attack since the war began , leaving at least 29 people dead . Trump posting Putin is needlessly killing a lot of people and warning the Russian president if he tries to conquer all of Ukraine , it will lead to Russia 's downfall . Now , this comes after these remarks on Sunday . I 'm not happy with what Putin is doing . He 's killing a lot of people and I do n't know what the hell happened to Putin . I 've known him a long time , always gotten along with him , but he 's sending rockets into cities and killing people , and I do n't it at all . , we 're in the middle of talking , and he 's tuning rockets in to give in other cities . I do n't it at all . I want to ask you about what we 're seeing here . It seems that Putin , at this point , is just thumbing his nose at the peace talks , at Trump , at Zelenskyy . And , , would you say he 's showing them he 's going to do what he wants no matter what is said ? I think that 's , Sarah . Another way to put it is that Putin continues to bob and weave in the boxing ring . He is not coming to grips with the fact that President Trump is , in fact , losing patience with him . And what ? When President Trump says that Vladimir Putin is absolutely crazy , I can give you my reaction to that in two words . Hallelujah . . welcome to Team West . Team Democracy . It 's really time we did more than just call out Vladimir Putin . And as you just heard , Jackie talking about a moment ago , I think the three levers that President Trump has over Putin are , number one , $ 300 billion in Russian assets that are frozen in Western banks under the control of Brussels . Number two , let 's give the Ukrainians more long range weapons so they can reach further into Russia itself and hold Russian infrastructure and military targets at risk . And I think , number three , and probably most obvious and could be done tonight would be sanctions , secondary sanctions . Anybody who does business with Russia can not do business with the United States . So bottom line , Sarah , we have leverage . President Trump sounds to me he 's ready to use it . Let 's hope they go forward in that spirit on this Memorial Day . . Look , at the same time , though , while we 're hearing him for the first time , really going after Putin , calling him absolutely crazy , as you mentioned , we 're also hearing him go after Zelensky again . Zelensky felt the United States was silent after this , the worst drone attack that they 've seen since the war began . And I 'm curious if this unfortunately levels the playing field in Trump 's mind because he 's also said to Zelensky , , to knock it off , that he does n't to hear what he has to say on this . What do you think , of the relationships and how that all plays into this ? Life is so often compared to what ? And compared to a couple of months ago when Zelensky was kicked out of the Oval Office and there were , I think , quite serious threats to simply cut off intelligence permanently . We had done so on a temporary basis that was really rocked bottom . So compared to then , I think we 're in a much better place . here 's would be my advice to President Zelensky . Manage your Trump account carefully now . This is not the time to be critical to say , , why have n't we heard more from the United States ? And frankly , hearing Donald Trump call Putin absolutely crazy , is a great moment for Ukraine . What I would be telling President Zelensky is stand up and applaud when you finally get the president of the United States to say what you need him to say and to be the leader of the band of the West . so I think it 's a moment for Zelensky to manage the Trump account . And it is , I hope , a moment where President Trump will , in fact , use leverage and not become impatient and just walk away from this situation . I 'm curious , there 's still money set aside that the Trump administration has not unleashed , has not using to give to Ukraine . Is there a real possibility that the United States , in the Trump administration itself , just bows out and lets things go , and whichever way it happens to go ? I certainly hope not . And of course , my successor as Supreme Allied Commander of NATO is sitting on top of all that equipment , all that additional weapons systems that could be flowed into that combat scene and I think helped the Ukrainians quite a bit . So this is the moment , in my view , for all who support Ukraine and their fight for freedom again on this Memorial Day . Now 's a good time to get behind Ukraine , encourage the administration to move those weapons systems forward . And last thoughts , Sarah . the European US are coalescing in this moment . You 're seeing Berlin and London , Warsaw . you 're seeing , Paris truly come together to , to say we stand with Ukraine . I think it 's a pretty good moment for the United States to say the same together . The U.S. and Europe are an unstoppable force . Putin can not succeed against that team . West . . And Europe are extremely , extremely concerned that Ukraine is just the first of potentially many that Russia could invade . Admiral James Stavridis , thank you so much and happy Memorial Day . I hope you are able to commemorate this day with your family . , joining me now live from London . Is Russia . Louise Savage . She is the head of the Ukraine Forum at the strategic think tank Chatham House . So , I just wonder whether you believe President Trump may finally be coming around to the position of Tim West , as that last guest described it ? Becky , of course , it 's encouraging to see , that President Trump , at least rhetorically , says that Putin has changed since he has known him . but to be honest , Putin has changed more than two decades ago . He has been sending rockets at the cities from Chechnya to Georgia to annexing Crimea . And this has been a clear pattern for what the region says . The world , the West , would to see action from . President Trump would to see what Zelensky said before even Trump was elected , that there 's only one pathway to this , and that is to say thanks . . I wonder then whether , you would hope to hear more on the threat of sanctions from Donald Trump at this point because , we have n't had any further detail on whether he would use , further sanctions on Russia as a lever . Do you believe that he will ? And do you expect that to have a significant impact on Vladimir Putin at this point ? , let 's also recall that before that round of diplomatic ping pong and faking of Russia , of elections , there was a decision between the European Union and United States to impose what they called catastrophic sanctions on Putin , does not agree to an unconditional cease fire . It is clear that Putin is doing the opposite . So now something has been prepared in the US , and that is a bipartisan bill that Lindsey Graham is championing and has more than 80 , backers . This could be , put into place tomorrow . this would again , targeted Russian oil in that sector . And that could have an effect simply by denying , income to the Russians to finance the war . War is very expensive . And and Russia is having a lot of pressure on its economy . and that could further strengthen pressure on Putin 's system and increase its military . . And I 'm sure any congressional movement then on this , bill would have , , keen support from both the Europeans and Ukraine , although , of course , it is . It is for the US to make those decisions in Congress . See the Kremlin downplaying Donald Trump 's comments today and very specifically calling them emotional reactions . Is that what you would expect to hear from the Kremlin ? I just wonder at this stage whether it is clear or not whether Vladimir Putin , frankly , is taking Donald Trump seriously here . , of course , what else would you expect from the cold blooded operatives in the Kremlin than to call the United States president for being emotional ? I think , Putin risks , disrupting his own strategy of procrastinating negotiations while trying to tempt , Trump into economic deals and the wider geopolitical cooperation beyond Ukraine on issues such as Iran , Middle East , and nuclear nonproliferation . This is what 's in jeopardy . It 's not just Ukraine , it 's the whole US Russian realignment and what is also striking what maybe you 've reported on it , but we do see today , key , suppliers for Ukraine 's missiles lifting restrictions on the range where they Ukraine is now able to hit deeper into the Russian territory to target logistics and military infrastructure . That is also a new phase in war that is significant . And that puts pressure on Putin that the that the United States is not withdrawing its assistance , but makes Ukrainian army more powerful ."
https://youtu.be/REnAtxcFUvA?si=7Y9obzB1qcCftRxm,Trump demands the 'names and countries' of foreign students at Harvard,cnn,REnAtxcFUvA,"President Trump is escalating his attacks on Harvard University , just days after a federal judge temporarily halted his administration 's ban on Harvard enrolling international students . The president is now demanding names and countries of the thousands of international students at the Ivy League school . Trump suggesting that foreign countries , some of which he says are hostile to the US , should contribute funding to educate their students . For more on this escalating feud , let 's go to Julia Benbrook near Trump 's New Jersey estate , where he 's spending the weekend . Julia , tell us more about the president 's sentiment here . , there is escalation in President Donald Trump 's ongoing battle with Harvard University . Just a couple of days ago , he was working to ban international students from attending Harvard , a move that was swiftly halted by a federal judge . And then overnight , we 're hearing from Trump again as he demands more information about the international students who attend writing this quote . Now , about 27 % of Harvard 's student body is of students from overseas , and they do release some of that information starting in 2024 . They do have a list of which countries those students are attending from . It 's important to note that , according to Harvard 's website and the student aid section , it makes very clear that foreign students are not eligible for federal funding and can instead apply for scholarships and things that through the college itself . Our team has spoken with multiple international students at Harvard , who describe the feeling now is one of uncertainty and even pure panic as Trump works to ban their enrollment . The university also responding calling , calling this move a clear retaliation for its refusal to meet some of the government 's demands on certain policies . They 're on campus , and this is just the latest in a long back and forth . We 're going to pull up some of those important moments and exchanges that happened over just the last several weeks now . The administration cut 450 million in federal grants , froze more than 2 billion in research funding , moved to ban international students . What we 're talking about today threatened to end the university 's tax exempt status , and is using the Department of Justice to investigate diversity initiatives . So , again , a lot of uncertainty for these international students at Harvard , but also uncertainty for the faculty , staff and other students as well . Fred . All . Julia Benbrook , thanks so much are with me now to talk more about these developments . Is Cornell William Brooks . He is the former president and CEO of the NAACP and is currently a professor at Harvard 's Kennedy School . Professor , great to see you . It 's good to see you as always . So what do you think is at the heart of President Trump 's obsession here ? that is a great word to describe it . It is an obsession because what we have seen over the over many weeks , many months is an ever shifting , exercise in arguments and excuses for going after Harvard , for , for no serious legal basis . meaning we have a federal judge , who 's issued a temporary restraining order against this ban against , nearly , 6000 , nearly 7000 international students , one out of every four at Harvard , six out of every ten at the Kennedy School where I teach . And what we have seen is over and over again , the Trump administration , using its just its lawyers to go after Harvard 's , fiscal , its budget , taking away , almost $ 3 billion after they admitted that they made a mistake . , that 's absolutely necessary . That 's just in the research funding the two . Three . That 's , that 's . So this threat is invoking fear . , students , especially international ones , , are terrified to go home for the summer while the back of the U.S .. But they get to finish at Harvard . , these are legit questions . So what are your concerns for these students , especially as you mentioned , six out of ten of the students there at the , , Kennedy School are international students . , I 'm very concerned . So I have students who would to go visit their parents , before graduation and come back with them , who are afraid that if they leave the country , they may not be able to get in . We have students who are afraid that they wo n't be able to continue their studies or start their studies , or even graduate . This is absolutely terrifying . And let us be clear here , this band that the Trump administration is attempting , attempting to impose is a ban on students from Switzerland to Sweden , from Palestine to Israel , from Kenya to France . and this is a band that hurts all kinds of students studying all kinds of subjects that serve the world . At the Kennedy School , we have students who are from India who are studying development . We have students from Nigeria who are studying ways to improve healthcare . The point being here is the Trump administration is engaging in a common war , a psychological war against students in an effort to punish a global university . largely as a result of the president , using Harvard as a toy , as a , as a political , if you will , to agitate and excite his base to the detriment of the country 's well - being and the good of the country . Think about this , Fredricka . at Harvard , we have hospitals who care for sick , dying , and patients who are in need of health care . We have students who create , the means by which we saw serious problems and all of that is being threatened by a president who 's having a temper tantrum at the expense of the country . and now , Harvard 's president is standing firm that the campus will not bend to the white House on a variety of policy changes . will Harvard be able to continue to dig in its heels and combat this white House ? I think we have to , because , first of all , with the president and the administration is asking Harvard to do is to violate the Constitution . There is a First Amendment in the Constitution which guarantees all persons , not merely all citizens , freedom of expression . We can not give in to that . We certainly can not give in to lessening our mission , diminishing the quality of our work , and the quality of our study and scholarship and research and practice , so that we can essentially , appease this president . So it 's not so much a matter of Harvard digging in its heels . It 's a matter of Harvard standing firm . And this president , , engaging in the temptation to the detriment of the country . So we have no other choice . do you feel pretty certain that it 's Harvard now and another university , private or public ? Next ? , most certainly . Most certainly . And all we need to do is listen to the president himself . The president has said that we 're looking at other universities and so the point being is we have to ask ourselves if Harvard , with the resources it has , is trying this hard at this expense . What about community colleges ? What about state universities ? , I went to a state , a HBCU , a c college . I went to a private university and Ivy League law school , and I went to Head Start , and we had this president going after all kinds of institutions of higher learning and secondary learning in this country . So the issue is it 's not this is not a matter of Harvard . This is a matter of education . And when it comes to education , that means the well - being of most Americans , nearly all Americans . So this is critically important . Harvard professor Cornell William Brooks , always great to see you . Thank you so much . Good to see you . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/fD65ApDVx_k?si=txR5aC2GmE7fDXSV,Zelensky: US encouraging Putin with 'silence' over barrage of attacks,cnn,fD65ApDVx_k,"All . New this afternoon , Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is accusing the U.S. of encouraging Russia 's Vladimir Putin by remaining silent after a weekend of Russian attacks on the capital , Kyiv , and other parts of Ukraine . CNN 's Paula Hancocks has the latest . We have seen a weekend of superlatives at the same time as seeing the largest aerial assaults from the Russian military on Ukrainian cities . We 're also seeing the largest prisoner exchange between the two countries . Now , starting with the positive , we did see over three days Friday , Saturday and Sunday , a total of 2000 prisoners being released , 1000 Russian , 1000 Ukrainian . Now this did happen . As I say , over three days we have been seeing some very emotional reunions , some very emotional images on the Ukrainian side as those coming off from busses draped in the Ukrainian flag are reunited with their loved ones . In some cases they have been held prisoner for a number of years now . We did hear from the Ukrainian leader , Volodymyr Zelensky , thanking everybody involved in this process . Sometimes many of them . The task is to bring home absolutely everyone who is currently held in Russia , and this is a joint task for our intelligence services , for our diplomats , for our entire state . Clearly , it 's not an easy task , but it must be accomplished . I 'm grateful to everyone around the world who is helping us now . According to the Ukrainian Prisoner of War Center , this is the sixth prisoner exchange that we have seen this year alone , and it is the 65th overall . And yet at the same time is seeing something as positive as this . We also saw a devastating weekend when it came to the aerial assaults on Ukraine . We saw from the Ukrainian Air Force saying that Saturday into Sunday there were almost 70 missiles , almost 300 drones . Now , many of them , they claimed , were intercepted , but those that got through were deadly . We know that children were among the dead and injured . Now they say there were drones that were cruise missiles , ballistic missiles fired from both ships and planes . According to the Ukrainian leader , rescuers were working in well over 30 cities and villages across the country . Now there were some 13 different districts that were impacted , but certainly what we saw in the capital , in Kiev in the early hours of Sunday morning was that the air raid sirens were blaring for hours . Residents were told to stay in shelters in the early hours of Sunday morning and over the weekend . That one parliament member , speaking to CNN said it felt Armageddon . So a very devastating and deadly weekend in a number of Ukrainian cities . Paula Hancocks , CNN , Abu Dhabi . All . Joining us now is Bill Taylor . He is former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council . Good to see you , ambassador . President Zelensky says a U.S. silence on the weekend attacks just encourages Vladimir Putin . Do you agree with that ? So , Fredricka , the world , the international community , the Americans and Europeans all have to condemn these attacks . it is it 's a it 's an indication , that the Russians think they can get away with this . It 's an indication that there 's no intent on the part of the Russians to seek a peace deal . there 's no there 's no willingness to negotiate . they continue , and that needs to be condemned . Absolutely . So in your view , is it just lip service that , Vladimir Putin wants some deal peace deal , ending war ? Whichever way you want to put it . Is this just a charade ? It 's a charade . You 're exactly . It is a charade . he is , trying to indicate the that he 's willing to make some compromises . No compromises . Every time he 's asked what he 's after , it 's essentially Ukrainian surrender . Ukrainians have been fighting for more than 3 to 3 and a quarter years . They 're not for surrender . They will not surrender . So Putin continues to push , the his army . his army , Fredricka , is not making progress . He 's not making progress on the ground . The only thing his army is that our armed forces can do is fire drones , as you just reporting , as I was just saying , firing drones and missiles , many of which they get from North Korea and Iran . That 's all they can do . they have no intent of stopping this attack . So would you say that the US hope , , is really futile ? , that the U.S. is wasting its time if there is going to be a bringing to the table , or does the U.S. need to consider something else if it wants to be a participant in helping to end this war ? What would that be ? That would be pressure on Putin to negotiate . that would be economic pressure , in the form of additional sanctions . And that would that would be in the form of additional weapons and military support for Ukraine . You 're indirectly stepping up on both counts . that is they 're putting on new sanctions . and they 're providing as much of the weapons as they can . Senator Graham , Senator Lindsey Graham in this country has some 83 co - sponsors . The 81 co - sponsors , in addition to the two sponsors on a bill that would put sanctions on Russia . This can be done . The American people support Ukraine and oppose Putin . the Senate is in strong position to put these sanctions on . That 's what can be done . , it is not hopeless . If the U.S. does n't provide , more weapons , then , , the onus is largely going to be on Europe . Does it have the ability , to do more , to go it alone , so to speak , to help Ukraine ? , it turns out , that some 40 % of the weapons being used on the battlefield now , coming from Ukrainians over Ukrainian factories . 40 % , are Ukrainian made weapons . 30 % coming from , Europeans are coming from the United States . so that 's of the Ukrainians are stepping up their ability to provide these , as are the Europeans . But you 're , Europeans do not have the military industrial complex , the defense industrial base , in order to provide the kinds of equipment that the Americans have provided . So the Europeans are willing to buy from the United States , from U.S. arms manufacturers . weapons for Ukraine . So that can happen . We just have to give them the to do that . All . Ambassador Bill Taylor , always a great pleasure having you . Thank you so much . Thank you Fredricka ."

Jewish American soldiers killed while fighting Nazis during World War Two . But for more than 80 years , they were mistakenly buried beneath Latin crosses . I went to an American cemetery in Italy with the nonprofit Operation Benjamin . As those inadvertent errors were corrected . And as we honor America 's fallen heroes this Memorial Day weekend . In this cemetery outside Rome , lay more than 7800 Americans killed in battle , liberating Italy during World War Two , now buried alongside rows of beautiful Roman pines . Faith in each other . And on this day , families of three soldiers traveled to Italy from the U.S. to honor their sacrifice . Today , we are setting the historical record straight . We will give them the marker that is appropriate for their faith . More than 80 years after they died . Correct . Inadvertent errors . Burial beneath Latin crosses instead of Jewish stars . We 're all here in some way to honor those who have rested here for all of these many years under an incorrect identity . All thanks to the nonprofit Operation Benjamin , which works with the American Battle Monuments Commission . Shalom Lamm is chief historian . Many of the service men who are buried under crosses even though they 're Jewish . It 's because they did n't want to show that they were Jewish on their dog tags . ? There was a real fear of being captured if you were captured by the Germans in particular . That was really terrifying . These are not purposeful . These were true errors . America really tried to get it , but they naturally missed some . And our job is to come back after all these decades and find those guys . It has happened again and again and again that I introduce people to someone who 's just a shadowy figure in their memory . They were real flesh and blood human beings , and we know that story . Stories that of technician fourth grade Ben Bernstein , his nieces and nephews , finally learned details of their uncle ’s sacrifice . A member of the elite First Special Service Force killed by a Nazi grenade on December 3rd , 1943 , in the Battle of Monte la Defensa . Your name is Ben . Correct You ’re named for your uncle . He was a hero . He was always a hero in everybody 's eyes . But we knew so little . We knew he stormed a hill in Italy and died . We knew he was a paratrooper . We knew he volunteered for force . That 's about it . [ prayer in Hebrew ] Now they are here giving their uncle a proper burial . This is the gravesite of Second Lieutenant Sheldon Fender , who was shot down and killed on August 16th , 1943 , during World War Two . As you can see here , he was Jewish , and he was laid to rest beneath a Jewish star . . The only other person to die in that very same mission in August of 43 was Paul Singer . He was also the only other Jew in that mission . He 's under a cross-- that 's going to change . In death , They are nine feet apart . In life . They were three feet apart . One was the navigator . One was the bombardier . Paul , on behalf of the . Members of your family and on behalf of the Jewish people . We welcome you all . Your cousin , Paul Singer died 82 years ago , and he 's been under a cross until today . What did . What did it mean to you to be here and to be a part of this ceremony , to honor his Jewish faith ? We are very committed Jews . So special to have something from your religion that 's now . And that 's connected families . He was our friend at 16 . He was an only child , ? Probably why it took so long to have this change . . Because they said they were trying to contact his aunts of his , But . . They did n't . , there was n't any other family . So it 's nice to be able to be here and represent the family , to be able to do this . Sheldon Fender 's family feels the same way . So this is your uncle ? It 's my uncle Sheldon . I have a great picture of my father and my uncle as his children . Did your dad . Talk about him ? Very little . Very little . I feel by being here today , I honor his quiet grieving for his entire life . Until now , there was never a proper funeral . , as a matter of fact , I do n't think anyone in my entire family has ever been here before . The two families met here in Italy for the first time . I knew the name , and I knew he was buried here . I did n't know he was buried this close . But then to meet them is really incredible . It puts a lot of meaning to this whole experience that it 's not just about one person . It 's about all of these individuals . Headstones in military cemeteries can only be changed with approval from soldiers families . Shalom Lamm does the research . The amount of proof we 're required to deliver to the American Battle Monuments Commission is really huge . It 's really tough and it should be tough . We 're changing something for eternity . The stone from the cross that 's removed never leaves the cemetery . We lower our heads in gratitude in respect to these silent civil sentinels who have so majestically stood guard over these young men for all of these decades . How magnificent is it that these men here in these grounds were comrades in arms against the common foe ? Good on one side , and absolute evil on the other . May their memories be a blessing . And this Memorial Day weekend , we honor . Ben Bernstein , Paul Singer , and Sheldon Fender and all of the American service members who 've made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for freedom around the world ."
https://youtu.be/xzjctqKvNA8?si=gPZ1DDPJgUbXNw4H,Expelled ambassador reacts to Trump's 'White genocide' claims,cnn,xzjctqKvNA8,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is being praised for how he handled himself during President Trump 's Oval Office meeting . Ramaphosa and his delegation visited the White House on Wednesday , hoping to stick to the topic of trade agreements . Instead , President Trump continued his practice of using the Oval Office news conferences as opportunities to try to intimidate or embarrass , rather than welcome show diplomacy . Trump brought out visual aids meant to back up his false claims that white South Africans are Afrikaners , the farmers , they are being persecuted . Ramaphosa , chief negotiator of the end of apartheid , kept his cool . Tensions between the two countries were high long before Ramaphosa arrived in Washington . In February , Trump issued an executive order freezing aid to South Africa over some of the same claims that he brought up . This week . In March , Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared South Africa 's ambassador to the US , Ebrahim Rasool , persona non grata and expelled him . , Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool joins me now from Cape Town . Mr. Ambassador , thank you for being with me . I want to talk a little bit about this meeting in the Oval Office and then look ahead at the relationship between the US and South Africa . First , President Ramaphosa said that it was not dramatic , but there are plenty of people who characterize it as an ambush of your president . What 's your view of what happened at the Oval Office ? , thank you very much . I think that the idea of an ambush is fairly accurate , in the sense that you do n't expect a president . You do n't expect diplomacy from a superpower to descend into such a haranguing , hectoring , blustering , engagement and so in that regard , when you come there with a decent , demeanor , you do n't expect it . But I do think that I agree with those who say that the South African delegation led by President Ramaphosa was united , was focused . It was diverse , of covering all opinions matters most importantly dignified . And certainly the body language spoke as to who was the adult in the room and who was not . Hmmm . I want to play for you a claim that the administration , uses to defend , its assertion that there is a genocide , and there 's persecution of white South Africans . let 's play that . This is from , Elon Musk and also from , the , a representative of the Department of Homeland Security . There are now 140 laws . In South Africa that give , that , give strong preference to , to if you 're , if you 're a black South African and not otherwise . There 's been over 140 laws enacted that are race based and to discriminate against racial minorities . Now , this claim , appears to originate with the South African Institute for Race Relations , which has had some , race related controversies of their own over the last couple of years . But how do you defend against that claim that there are laws , 140 of them , that discriminate against white South African ? I think that if you consider the entire law book of apartheid , then amending 140 them is tinkering with what apartheid meant for black people . If one of the laws says give blacks more jobs , if one of the laws says give blacks more opportunities in the economy , give them more ownership , give them more land , then those are 140 very few laws that try to overturn apartheid while keeping the edifice of reconciliation going without former oppressors and supremacists in the white community . And so what they hold up as transformation laws of apartheid is , in fact , an indictment that we may have moved too little , too slowly in overturning the legacy of apartheid . And so when Elon Musk says that , he can not get a Starlink contract in South Africa , although , since the meeting , there have been , there 's progress to make exceptions for him to do that . And he says it 's absurd that he , as a man born in South Africa , can not get that . What 's your response to him ? Who says that is discriminatory ? What is different , for example , to what Mr. Trump says ? Then he says Arabs can come into the United States with their investments , but they will be required to make a partnership with American companies so that they pull together . I think that what we are seeing is , a very conventional approach by countries who want to be part of the growth of a company , and therefore I think there are 600 American companies , and the experience is one of booming in South Africa , a thriving in South Africa and of making enormous progress and profits in South Africa . And so I really think judging by the 600 American companies who are thriving versus one who is complaining simply because he 's been asked to share ownership of his project with black South Africans , which is no different to what Mr. Trump is saying to foreign investors who come in and who are asked to put up joint plants and manufacturing plants with Americans . You talked about the need for South Africa to rebuild its relationship , repair its relationship with the United States without abandoning its , values . and after your expulsion , President Ramaphosa named a special envoy to the United States to rebuild that relationship . his name is , Mcebisi Jonas . I want to play for everyone . Something that Mr. Jonas said this was during a lecture . November of 2020 . This is the man that President Ramaphosa has highlighted to rebuild the relationship with the United States . now , the US is undergoing a watershed moment with Biden . The certain winner in the presidential race is the racist , homophobic homophobe Donald Trump . How we got to a situation where a narcissistic wing took charge of the world 's greatest economic and military powerhouse is something that we need to ponder over . , if you consider why you were expelled from the U.S and this is the man who 's supposed to repair the relationship . Racist , homophobe . Narcissistic winger . How is he the person to rebuild ? You are not going to get a black South African who suffered under apartheid , went to prison the two of us , was persecuted and hounded into the underground . Denying the evidence of the eyes . When we look at the United States today and I called it the premier system , he called it all those names . But the fact is that when a piece of good as a hinge , it begins to look a door . When it has a handle , it begins to smell a door . And when it opens and closes , it is a door . And so I think it is a moment in which the latest victims globally of white supremacism and apartheid , when we recognize those signs , we respond with the DNA of having been the last victims of supremacism in South Africa . And so I think we 've got to get past that . We 've got to be able to say that he has a business brain extraordinaire . He 's able to keep his eye on the trade relations . He 's been a successful person . He knows finances . And I think that is what is going to be required . And I 'm hoping that with Mr. Trump having had my blood , that they will be able now to get on as I think they did , in the Wednesday meeting , despite the bluster and the theater of the Oval Office , I think good talks were ahead . the basis of trade , even on Starlink . And I think that 's the foundation from which to repair the relationship . Former South African ambassador to the United States , Ebrahim Rasool . Thank you ."
https://youtu.be/282lLFfauw4?si=Ff7ulW1eUzj9ppcB,Trump's dinner for more than 200 wealth crypto investors was his 'personal time',cnn,282lLFfauw4,"This private secret dinner in which individuals who have pu in Donald Trump 's pocket get access to him , is maybe the most corrupt of all of the corruption . Donald Trump 's dinner is a. Is a an orgy of corruption . Democratic lawmaker is using some colorful language to describe President Trump 's private black tie dinner last night for the top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin . One of those investors is a Chinese born crypto entrepreneur posted this video giving us an inside look at the exclusive event CNN has learned that the 220 wealthy guests dined on filet mignon and halibut , and that the president gave a 20 minute speech . Here 's a bit of that , and we pave the way for the strategic reserve to acquire even more Bitcoin in the years ahead . We have a strategic reserve . They also created the United Sta Digital Assets stockpile , so the government can leverage the power of crypto assets for the first time ever . that genius . And it 's really becoming it 's becoming powerful . The white House says the president attended the event in his personal capacity . But critics , our next guest says the dinner presented foreig with the opportunity to purchase access to the presid With us now is Democratic Senato Richard Blumenthal of Connecticu Senator , thanks so much for being with us I want to play for you some sound from the press secretary , Karoline Leavitt , specifically talking about Trump 's presence at this dinner . Let 's listen . The president is attending it in his personal time . It is not a white House dinner . It 's not taking place here at the white House . Senator , should the U.S. president be allowed to partake in a function this during personal time ? , the function reflects and the scam is that this access the president because he was president , not because he 's Donald Trump , the private citizen , is the result of his office . And in effect , he 's putting himself for sale sign on the white House . He is , in effect , saying to the investors in his crypto meme coin that they can gain access to him and he will know who they are if they have , for example , inves underway as the top investor has Justin Sun has a case before the and remember that the meme coin has no value in its tied to any specific asset . Its function is simply a specula item , and it is the result of sp in being tied to the president and the access that has been sol So it is really the height of sc unprecedented and unconscionable selling the office in effect , and the functions just reflects that scam . It is truly putting this president on a mount Rushmore of corruption . We should note that case that you mentioned was put on hold in February . I 'm curious about the substance of what some of the attendees shared with reporters . They argue that this venture is part of an effort to modernize the economy and to embrace financial innovation in a way that the previous administration I wonder how you respond to that and whether you have any evidenc that the attendees had private time with the president to lobby for any change with regulation in regard to cryptocurrency ? , let 's be realistic . They may not have had time last to lobby with him , but he can look around the room and there 's a record of who atte He knows full well how much they 've invested . And by the way , there was a leaderboard , a compe and a contest for who was going to invest the most and the one who invested the most was Justin Sun You spoke earlier about his SEC It was paused and negotiations begun to settle it shortly after , he began investing in this meme So the president does n't have to talk to anybody in that for him to know who is putting money in his pock And let 's be very clear , the sole function of this meme c is to put money into his pocket , funnel cash to his family . It is the most blatant outright misuse of office in the nation 's Senator , I also want to ask you about the situation with Harvard , this legal fight , and a judge temporarily blocking the administration 's efforts to international students enrolling in the university . The the administration says that this is an effort to root o pro terrorist , anti - Semitic activity on campus . It does come at a time when we were seeing Jewish people get murdered on th for their beliefs in this countr I wonder what you make of the administration 's efforts to address anti - Semitism . Harvard is making an effort to a anti - Semitism . It has taken steps to stop the h of students on campus and to end any terrorist activity that could in be interpreted as supported by H But , the irony here is the administration is saying Harvard is coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party And yet at that dinner last nigh a number of the meme coin buyers were from China . You can bet they have a connection to the Chinese govern And the problem with that meme coin dinner is that it makes him beholden to foreign interests in a way that they Emoluments Cl sought to prevent . That 's why I went to the floor of the Senat and asked that we have a vote on all of these payments the pla the meme coin and others , and that we have a list of who was at tha It 's undisclosed . We know nothing about who was th And Harvard is standing up to this administr and in its slide toward a surveillance state , the demands it is making are purely retaliatory . And their violation of the First Amendment , which is why a court today put a temporary restraining orde the administration 's demands from Harvard and its ending of the visa program that students , international students to attend Harvard . It 's a blatant violation of law , unconscionable and unpleasant , a an intrusion on academic freedom because what the administration wants to do is tell Harvard what to teach , who should teach , and who should be students there And that is a violation of academic freedom . But the First Amendment , because it 's based on viewpoints not on terrorist activity or coordination with the Chinese Communist Party Senator Richard Blumenthal , we have to leave the conversatio Very much appreciate your time . Thank you . Our panel is back with us now , and we want to talk more about T meme coin dinner last night to L Initially , when this invitation there was an indication that some of the top spenders on this meme coin . We 're going to get a private tou of the white House that was since scrapped after it was reported on . We do n't know exactly where this private tour is going to take place yet , do w We do n't know , but we do know that a lot of the top spenders are people from foreign countries , and this is a new way for them t to our political system , to donate to the person in power in the white House . Foreigners are not allowed to do political donations through because of legal restrictions . This is a new avenue that Trump has opened up , and we saw a number of foreign officials , a number of foreign b people took advantage of that , and they realized that not only will they be able to attend this dinn but they will be able to have th private period , the smaller grou where they could lobby the presi A lot of them publicly said that they were going to be lobbying the president . So that is a big concern that we heard from the senator and that we 're hearing from Democrats as well . So she on the idea that the sena and some of his colleagues are going to investigate this di it 's going to be tough , really , to point to something that was blatantly illegal , won ' , I think that you 're . I think what ? But I think the hard part about all of this and what Trump and the administration understan while they say he was in his personal capacity , you 're never in your personal ca when you 're president of the United States . There is no personal capacity . So I agree it can be very difficult for Con especially a House in the Senate The Democrats do n't necessarily run now for them to invest and for there to be consequences And that 's the problem with all of these things , is that Trump feels he can do whatever he wants because Democrats do n't have control of the House or the Senate . They do n't have . They can try to call people up to the Hill , they can try to investigate this But what authority do they really have ? And that 's the problem . In addition , the Supreme Court said that last year that essentially Donald Trump can does n't necessarily does n't could n't be prosecuted . And so they gave him an open door to do whatever he wants . And so I think this has led to t this , the corruption potentially taking foreign money and benefiting off of all th It makes you want to sta coin , does n't it ? Do n't I do n't think mine would do as w but look , I think one can , think that crypto is innovative and good and support Trump admin policy on crypto while also thinking this is a terrible idea . And what we 've seen with Donald Trump is everything that he want He wants to do it bigger and better than anybody e Corruption as well . When I first started in campaign in politics , I remember we 're talking about Bill Clinton in the Lincoln Bedroom . And then a few years later , we learned that even presidents have private lives , private capa And so what we 've seen is then , , obviously , Hunter Biden 's terrib artwork is going to donors . Donors have all kinds of access . This is a new way of doing it . It obviously allows foreign donors as well . And it 's a much bigger way . It should cause a lot of problem I ca n't wait for one Republican or Senate member to say that pub"

That 's what one Iranian official tells our friend Pleitgen about talks with the U. president Trump 's hopes of a breakthrough with Iran in danger as the Iranians are n't even happ with his chief negotiator , Steve Wyckoff for plug in is out front in Tehr My only death to America and Death to Israel chants at Friday prayers in Tehran and the prayer leader laying into the Trump administration as the U.S. Iran nuclear talks hang in the b Iran 's leadership is telling the United States that they want a nuclear agreeme but they 're also not afraid of a confrontation . If the talks fail . Tehran not happy with both Presi Trump and his chief negotiator , Steve Wyckoff , after Wyckoff said the U.S. would n't allow Iran to continue enriching uranium as part of any deal . No way . There is no trust . This member of the elite Revolutionary Guard Corps tells me they failed their previous tests towards the Iranian nation . However , we have initiated the t to prove our intention is not wa We want the enrichment for medic and other purposes , not we also . The negotiations are unilateral . This woman says Trump is trying to show his powe but it is our to have nuclear capability . Iran has consistently said its nuclear program is purely civilian in nature , and Tehran insists on keeping its uranium enrichment capabilities . Iran 's foreign minister acknowle the talks are complicated . We stressed the positions and principles of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding the negotiations , he s Our positions are completely cle and we insist on them . I think the American side now has a better and more clear picture of our po President Trump is threatening even tougher measures against Iran at the talks fail , and American officials tell CNN intelligence suggests Israel is preparing for strikes against targets in I Iranians we spoke to vowing a tough response . If that happens , that the United States knows bet what will happen , he says . If things get serious , there will not be a country named Israel on Earth . But for now , both sides say they 're gearing up for the next round of talks , trying to forge a new nuclear de I know , know , Erika , of course , the US saying that progress continues to be ma but there is still work to be do Of course , for the Iranians , that main sticking point remains uranium enrichment . That is something where they say it is their and they 're not going to walk ba from that . Erica , Fred , appreciate the reporting tonight Thank you . Growing skepticism today after a fifth round of indirect nuclear talks with the United St and Iran in Rome , the U.S. insists Iran dismantled its uranium enrichment program , a crucial element to the manufacturing of nuclear while Iranian officials say that 's a red line . CNN 's Fred Pleitgen is in Iran 's capital , T Fred , what 's the mood there ? There , Phil ? , there is certainly a lot of skepticism here on the ground . At the same time , the Iranians are saying these talks are continuing , and as long as they continue , there is a chance for a positive But you 're absolutely . The Iranians today , after those this comes in the form of the foreign minister , who 's also the lead negotiator for the Iranians . He came out and he said that the talks were very professional , as he pu But it seems as though what was as far as the Iranians are conce is they say that the US now better understands Iran 's position than they did be Now , it does n't really sound a lot of progress on the fa That 's also the vibe that we 're getting here on the streets of Tehran as well We read Friday prayers earlier today and on the sidelines of those pr I spoke to a couple of people and got their view . Here 's what they told me . That our Supreme Leader says we do n't want a nuclear weapon . We do n't need one because our power lies in our be in God . Look , you have misled . I hope this round will be previous rounds , and the common points of the par will get closer so that both countries will bene But considering the differences that exist , a result seems a bit out of reac that . The negotiations are unilateral . Trump is trying to show his powe but it is our to have nuclear capabilities . We do n't want anything dangerous , just for medical purposes and agriculture . That 's . Those are a couple of folks that we were speaking to earlier today on the sidelines of those Friday And that really is the main issu for the Iranians , and the one that they say is definitely the most difficult in those talks , and that is that a rich enrichme by the Iranians . They say , first of all , they have a to that . But they also say it 's a technol that they 've been working on for such a very long time , that homegrown enrichment capabi And it 's not something that they 're willing to give up . It 's quite interesting to hear a from the US side , after those ta we did n't hear directly from Steve Wyckoff , but certainly a source close to Steve Wyckoff saying that the US also believes that progress continues to be ma But there are still a lot of fac that need to be worked on , so neither side saying they believe that there 's going to be a breakthrough comin But both sides at least say they are going to m for the talks . Not too distant future , Phil . Fred Pleitgen for us in Tehran . Thanks so much . Joining us now , Brett McGurk . He was the special envoy under multiple presidents , National Security Co coordinator under President Bide But you were involved in Iran ta I want to start with wh Fred reported . There were Romney officials were saying about the meeting , saying that the better the U.S. better understand their position than they did before . I understand it seems it may seem innocuous t What are those words mean to you Well , look , this is one of the most complicated files in Washington . So I give Steve a lot of credit for taking this on . It 's complicated issue wise . It 's about nuclear physics . It 's about sanctions . It 's complicated politically in both capitals . But look , President Trump put a deadline on these talks in March over . , you have to get a deal in two mo And we 're at two months . And this now seems to just be a rope a dope . I 've negotiate with the Iranians I can see exactly what they 're d Look , this issue this year is a critical year . Let me tell you why . Two things . What 's left of the Obama era JCP One provision in it that even the critics of that de really is called snapback . That means any member of that ag including the UK and France , can go to the U.N. Security Council and say all U.N sanctions come back on Iran without having to have a vote in Security Council . It 's unilat That expires in October . And that is a key piece of lever against the Iranians . The Iranians know that . And the Brits and the French have been pretty hardliners . They say we 're ready to do that . If we do n't have a new deal , but that 's going to expire later this year . Another point about this . , Phil , I was in the Situation Room on October 1st last year , 200 ballistic missiles coming from Iran to Israel . takes 30 minutes for that flight And I kept thinking at that mome if one of those missiles ever had an Iranian nuclear warh I do n't care if it 's five years , 20 years from now . just think about , what could hap , this country , Iran can not be on the threshold of having nuclear weapon . So this issue has to be dealt wi It can be dealt with militarily as President Trump has threatene It can be dealt with diplomatica We want a diplomatic resolution . But as I see this going on , I just do n't see this moving to a resolution . And you 're talking about more ta I 've seen this pattern before . I think the Iranians just want t string this out . But if the key lever is the October snapback provisions from other JCPoA , sig presumably that 's the window here . I know , I know , the president put a two month time limit on it . Is that the reality ? It 's we 're going to go up to rope a dope until October , and then someone 's got to make this is a critical issue , a crit this coming months . , snapback expires in Octo But to really implement it , the Europeans would have to move this summer . So the coming months are really critical here . I thought that deadline Trump put on back in March was . increasing sanctions pressure is of the Russians . Iran is continuing to export significant amounts of , oil . and military pressure . You have to have a credible military threat in th to really put teeth on this . And also the reason I was confident this you get a pretty good d Iran is in the weakest position it has been in decades . And the Israelis took out all of their strategic air defen back in October . Iran , economically is in deep di It 's lost Hezbollah , its main proxies around the regi So the everything 's lined up here for a deal . But the Iranians are very good at just stringing things out . Let 's meet today in Rome for two Let 's meet again in two weeks in And before it , you just run out of time I ask you , what you a flashback to which , by the way people may not remember that because it went miraculously , so well and miraculously , there was there was a reason why it went w I know you 're deeply involved in the US Israel relationship now , there 's a lot of reporting out about potential attacks , the relationship between , Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Trump . sources telling CNN U.S. envoy Steve Wyckoff is set to me with Ron Dermer , confidant of , P Minister Netanyahu , on the sidelines of these talks and Rome , of where does that relationship sit now ? I think it 's pretty solid . There 's always tension in that relationship . I think it 's pretty solid . But Israel is concerned abo that does n't really take care of the problem . Their concern about an interim d that kicks the can and then snapback expire And so that 's where you get a lot of this tens Look , I think it 's very good . Ron Dermer and David Barnea , the director of Mossad , someone I know very well , was also in Rome talking to Steve on the sidelines of the I think that 's good . End of the day , a President Trump has a lot of p because he 's got political force in Washington to do a deal . there 's only so Bibi has limited maneuvering room , with Trump . but you have to get a good deal . And I think to get a good deal on these issues , , everyone talks about enrichment . It 's not just the enrichment pro It is since Trump left the JCPoA Iran has installed or produced new generations of centrifuges . You have to take care of the cen the stockpiles of highly enriched uranium . It is a very , very complicated set of issues . It takes weeks and months to negotiate of constant negotia So I 'm a little concerned here . We 're being strong along . and I think you got to put some on this . Every , every negotiation has to have a And , Trump said two months ago it 'll be two months . We 're at that point . So we 're now at the point of thi can just go rope a dope . And I just I think he got to put a little teeth in here or we 're not going to get a deal"
https://youtu.be/sNEFKylwgL4?si=2fBFLj-cI4ckEnSx,A major escalation': Matt Egan on potential impact of tariffs,cnn,sNEFKylwgL4,"I want to get to different contests where they 're all congratulating us . And , it 's lucky it is . It 's a funny moment that was President Trump interrupted at once , but twice , allegedly by two different congressmen today in the Oval Of by his iPhone ringing . Now just moments after saying that the 25 % tariff he threatened to place on Apple will also apply to other smartphone makers if they do n't produce their products here in the US . He also turned up the pressure in a major way on the EU , imposing 50 % tariffs , set to go into effect on June 1s I 'm not looking for a deal . , we 've set the deal . It 's But again there is no tariff if they build their plant here . Now if somebody comes in and wants to build a plant here , I can talk to them about a little bit of a delay . But , , while they 're building their pla which is something I think that appropriate , maybe . So what 's the potential impact to the U.S. economy ? CNN 's Matt Egan is at the Magic . So this would be a major escalat in the president 's trade wars . And this definitely caught investors off . They had been relieved about the fact that trade tensio seem to be calming down . Now they 're heating back up . Just to remind you how we got he Last month , the president briefly imposed 20 % tariffs on t Then he lowered them to 10 % to allow for time for negotiatio Now he 's not happy about how those talks are going . And he 's threatening a 50 % tariff on the EU . just to give you some contex the EU is America 's biggest trading partner . Far and away we 're talking about almost $ 1 tr worth of imports and exports between the US in the EU last ye That 's more than with Mexico , more than with Canada . It 's more than with China and Japan combined . When you look at what the U.S. gets from the EU , we 're talking about more than $ 6 billion worth of goods last year It 's not just the BMW and the Volkswagens from Germany We 're also talking about aircraf pharmaceutical products , machine wine and other alcoholic beverag And if you put a 50 % tariff on those goods , there 's obviously a risk that they 're going to get expensive , more expensive potentially a lot more expensive that 's why economists over at Barclays , they say that they view this threat of a 50 % tariff as a negotiating tactic . But they do caution that if these tariffs did go int they would weigh on both GDP gro and they would further boost inf So you could have a situation where you have slower growth and higher prices . And we do n't know yet exactly how the EU is going to r but they 've already set in motio potential retaliatory tariffs on more than $ 100 billion of goods that they buy from the United St And it 's those retaliatory tarif that could kill U.S. jobs . Now , it 's not just the EU that the preside is threatening with his favorite Also , it is one of America 's biggest companies . Apple . Apple joining a growing list of companies that have been attacke by the president so far this And the thing Apple has in commo with Amazon and Mattel and Walma is how it 's linked to tariffs , r The president is threatening at least a 25 % tariff on Apple unless they move manufacturing back to the United States . But the problem is , the cost of labor here in the US is so much higher that this is something that not only Apple could n't do overnight , . It would take 5 to 10 years , but it would make the iPhone more expensive , way more expensi There 's estimates out there that if the iPhone was made in t each one would cost $ 3,500 a pie ? That is prohibitively expensive for many Americans . And that 's why veteran analyst t Dan Ives says that they believe this concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale . And he says it 's one that is not feasible . And look , even if Apple found a way to som make it economical , it is not clear at all that they 'd be able to find enough workers in the US who have the skills and frankly , the desire to build Back to you , Phil . Otherwise straight path . Madigan , thanks so much with me is the US national editor of the Financial Times , Ed Lewis who is also the author of a remarkable New b that 's going to hold it up . We 've got a graphic so big , the life was a big Nev Brzezinski , America 's power prop I want to talk about that in just a moment . We were already talking about it during the break , but I do want to start with what 's going on . I do n't know how your Friday mor Mind was interrupted by the re ignition of a pretty substantial trade th starting with the EU . Treasury Secretary Scott Benson earlier today . Take a listen . I would hope that this would lig a fire under the EU because , Bill , I 've said before , EU has a collective action problem So some of the feedback that I 've been getting is that the underlying countries do n't even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf . Why ? I want to point that out . The president a couple of hours later said , I do n't want to deal . And this is the constant tension that those of us covering t Is this a negotiating strategy ? Is it to light a fire the Treasury secretary is s or is this , is this the end game Is this the outcome ? What do we think here ? So , the one thing that I strongly agree with , Secretary Benson , Scott Benson about is there is a collective action pro with the 27 member states is different to doing a deal with Saudi Arabia or even the UK , where one government can react q They have to consult a lot of governments , but I suspect when they consult those 27 governments , with 1 or 2 exceptions , Hungary , there 's a real digging and digging in appeals here that , we are the largest trading bloc in the world . We are , as in a European Union . and we 're not going to be intimi these casino hold tactic This is a game of bluff . And we 're not going to lose at this game of bluff . So the EU is not that different in fact to China and saying you can not push us around . We 're not the UK . and we 're not a Gulf Kingdom . so I do n't know whether this is the end of , , 50 % , , raising the cost of those $ 600 billion imports to $ 900 billion . in terms of the cost to the American consumer , I do n't know whether Trump think this is the end game . I do n't think he knows whether it 's the end game . he changes his position and it 's unfocused . That 's that 's the real problem You can not predict what he 's going to do real quick if you want to move on . It 's what 's around the book . But what does that do to negotia when you talk to diplomats or trade teams that are involved in the dozens of negotiations that are ongoing now , that what does it do ? So , , the one deal that Trump has trumpeted , is the UK deal . and if you look at the contents of that deal , there really aren ' It 's a framework with lots of blank placeholders . so even the word deal , let alone agreement means , you k you thrashed out something that will last for yea But the UK breathed a sigh of re They felt they 'd dodged a bullet , but they 've come back to a baseline of 10 % . which is not a victory . It 's just a worse outcome avoide So that 's not really the model f the EU . It 's not really the model for Ch It 's not really the model for an It 's very , very hard to negotiat with the president who can tank the markets with a tweet and without any warning . It is certainly different than normal diplomatic relations See what I did ? This is a segue to the book , which I , I was genuine in telling you during the break , and I 'm not all the way through but it 's an extraordinary work . And I want to ask you , you have access to things people just have n't . Before the family did n't ask for anything . explain how what you have access to because it connects to the Pope in a way that I think is really , really extraordinary . , thank you very much for those kind words . , the raw material , the primary material that partly I was given by the f which is the diaries he kept . He used a dictaphone from the white House back to his home in Virginia every night , spoke in full parag That first draft of history , these enormous diaries . I got exclusive access to the correspondence with Pope John Paul the Second , who , of course , Brzezinski , came from Poland , which was in Polish and extraord really historic , exchange of letters over many , many years . Brzezinski had piece of Pope on his white House phone , so he could get through to the Vatican straight away . and that helped prevent the Soviet invasion of Poland , of that relationship . It was a really seminal but tons of stuff . The Polish secret police files and the and the Soviet one ones on Brzez I had those translated , all his childhood stuff . , you need to get the formative st for a real biography . Those earl The reason is it 's so timely , given we 've seen JD Vance and Vice President Vance g and you start to think , , we is this a thing that 's happened , it has . And the illustration , the picture you paint here and t and the outcome , which are so dramatic on some of Are you a little bit hopeful ? I do ask , look , he was a maverick in terms of Partizan politics , r And 88 , he did n't endorse the Democrat , if I recall correctly . is there anything is there anybody any more ? he 's really unusual . It 's one of the reasons I was at to doing a biography of him . , he was a grand strateg He was Kissinger 's Henry Kissing great rival . But unlike Kissinger , he was n't much of a team play , he was a very , very independent minded , , argue with Jimmy Carte the president . He served it . They 'd had stand up fights . , this was n't a Rubio Tr relationship , let 's put it he was n't a hawk . He was n't a dove . He was n't a re He was n't an idealist . He was a Democrat . But as you point out , he endorse Bush over Dukakis in the 88 election , voted for Nixon over McGovern in He was his own person . And it 's quite hard to get ahead in any political capital , including Washington , D.C. , if you do n't belong to a tribe and stick to that tribe 's rules and absorb its memos and then , , faithfully regurgitate them , he really , really did n't do that He was , his own person ."

Legendary musician Billy Joel is taking a break , canceling all upcoming tour dates because of a neurological disord A statement on the singer 's Instagram page today says , under his doctor 's instructions , Billy is undergoin specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period . And the statement Billy Joel says , , I 'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience . CNN chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon Doct Sanjay Gupta joins us now . Sanjay , what people through the diagnosi . No one likes to hear news t but let me let me talk you throu There may be some potential treatments for him . This is something known as normal pressure hydrocephalus Now , hydrocephalus may be a term people are familiar with . They think about water on the br Typically think about that happening in babies . But it can happen in adults as w And let me show you these images You get an idea of what this loo in an adult brain . You have normal fluid filled spa So on the left , that 's what the brain should loo That 's normal . On the , you can see those black areas in the middle fill . Those are the ventricles , and they carry cerebral spinal f And you can see that they 're muc in the scan on the . That is normal pressure hydrocep and so that is something that happens t in people over the age of 65 . And it can cause all sorts of different symptoms that I 'm sure have led to him canceling the tour . How common i that this is not that common ? but it is one of those things , I 'll tell you interestingly , just because this is my area of expertise , patients oftentimes will come in with symptoms such as difficulty with walking , bounce difficultie They may have difficulty with their bladder control . They may have difficulty with co oftentimes it is confused for th Alzheimer 's disease , for ex or even Parkinson 's disease . Patient comes in that , they get a scan and all of a sudden they see this normal pressure hydrocephalus , which again , you do n't want to get any of these diagnos but this is potentially a treatable problem . So it 's not common , but it can be a mimic of a lot of other neuro diseases out there . So you mentioned area of experti You operate on patients with this condition . Tell us about the treatment . . So it 's interesting . So think about that fluid again . That fluid is circulating around the brain around the spin First of all you can take a needle and do what 's called a lumbar pu which is a needle in the lower back and drain some of that fluid when you drain some of that flui the patient might pretty rapidly feel better improving their gait improving their walking and improving their cognition . If that happens and it does happ a fair number of times , then you can do something that 's a bit more permanent . So this is this is the brain . you would put a cathet through the brain into one of those fluid filled s I mentioned , and then using a catheter sort o that fluid into the abdomen , for that 's called a shunt . Something else that people may have heard of . And I got to tell you , this is rare , but when it comes to someone with what Billy Joel is describi it could potentially be a very treatable problem . I think that 's what they 're hopi I 'm sure he 's having those discu with his doctors now . , I think we 're all hoping f Doctor Sanjay Gupta , always , always grateful for your experti Thanks so much ."

The Dow , S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ending the worst week this month for all three major indices . The uninspired results on Wall S today , a result of President Tru injecting a new wrinkle into his global trade war . Within the past hour , the president in the Oval Office saying this I 'm not looking for a deal . , we 've set the deal . It 's But again , there is no tariff if they build their plan to you . Now , if somebody comes in and wants to build a plant here , I can talk to them about a little bit of a delay . Not looking for a deal . Those comments coming just a few hours after he posted that the European Union has been very difficult to deal with , and adding that he 's , , recommending a 50 % tariff on all imports from the E.U. starting June 1st . Now , Europe is n't alone in these new threats . The president today also putting Apple and other smartphone makers on notice , demanding the company make iPhones in the US or face a 25 % tariff . An administration official tells CNN that Apple CEO Tim Cook met with the president at the white this past Tuesday , though the official did n't say what the two talked about . On an earnings call earlier this month , cook told investors that he expe Apple would face a tariff burden of nearly $ 1 billion just this quarter billion with a Later , during remarks in the Oval Office , Trump expanded his threa to include Samsung and anybody making smartphones outside the United States . Let 's discuss with former Treasu secretary and former president of Harvard , Larry Summ Larry , great to see you . So Trump also just announced a partnershi between U.S. Steel and Japanese steelmaker Ni that he says will keep the headq of U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh and draw $ 14 billion of investment toward the economy . He said this as he was boarding Marine One . He 's headed to Bedminster for the weekend . I wonder what your reaction is to that news . I do n't know the details well enough to , to comme I guess it 's good that some arrangement has been m That merger was obviously a good for the U.S. economy , and had been blocked by the Biden administration , and then had been blocked by , the Trump administration . So the idea that something is being worked out is , I suppos But I find the whole approach of constantly moving goalposts , deal making with individual companies based on the president 's personal loyalties that he 's taking to economic pol to be disaster virus . And I think ultimately it 's going to have very bad consequen for our economy . I wonder , Larry , how you read his statements today . , he started off by saying that he 's recommending 50 % tariffs on the then later said , we already said It 's at 50 % . How do you think the US is ? A rather the EU is absorbing those statem I think the president state is showing himself to be someone who you ca n't make a deal with . And have that deal stick . And I think that 's very costly for our country . I think ultimately it raises que about how trusted we are going to be in financial And that 'll mean higher interest rates , higher borrowing costs , higher mortgage I think it 'll mean over time a weaker dollar , which means we 'll have to pay mo for everything , that we import . And so I think at a time when we 've never had m and we 're never accumulating government debt so rapidly to alienate the whole rest of th that holds a substantial fraction of that d is a very misguided strategy . If I were sitting in China , I would be cheering all of this I would be thinking that the president , United States , is what was a strong country with a strong economy and cutting it off from the rest of the world and building up its rate of accu of debt as rapidly as he could . That 'd be hard for me to imagine receiving a greater strategic gi What do you make of his threats toward Apple and other smartphon 25 % tariffs if they do n't make their smartph in the United States ? , what would that mean for consume I think consumers would much rat buy smartphones cheap than make I do n't know many people who are looking for jobs assembling smartphones in a fact and we 're sitting with a large n of manufacturing jobs all alread So why we would want to move people from the jobs they have now to jobs making sma I can not imagine , and I ca n't imagine an economy that 's ever more abou information , about interconnecti than that . Jacking the price of smartphones is going to be a big burden on American families . So this seems to me almost compl misguided as economic policy . I also want to ask you about the president 's battle with Harvard , the tuition and fees from international stud generate a large portion of a university 's income , and Harvard has already lost billions in grants and funding . Do you imagine that the school is going to endure some financial hardship because How much more pressure can it ta , a court has already reve the president 's , decision , at least on a temporar The finances are a blow to Harva but Harvard 's a wealthy university and can man What 's much more serious is the blow that this is to our As we alienate thousands of peop whose dream was to come study in the United States at Harvard . As we send away the people who were going to be the next generation of entrepreneurs , of our great c as we enter fear with , the ongoing research projects that are curing diseases , cancer and , diabetes . That 's what this is about . It 's about showing whether we 're a generous nation that is open to the world and proud of what people can lea or whether we 're at war with the idea of learning and teaching students from all over the world . It 's about whether the United States is goi a moral beacon . That 's my focus today , and I think that 's the focus of most people . Harvard is being used to send a and that message is a very , very dangerous one . Courage is contagious . Harvard has shown courage in usi all the legal redress mechanisms open to it . And I 'm glad they 'll continue to Beyond the moral argument that you 've made , there 's also an economic one , and you alluded to it . I 'd for you to expand on it It 's the entrepreneurial injection that these , foreign students represent for the US economy . ? There was a Stanford study that found that 44 % of U.S. unicorn companies , those are startups valued at $ 1 billion or more , are founded or co - founded by immigrants and specifically for Harvard . Axios found that around 24 of those companies were co - fo or founded by Harvard International students . So ultimately , what would this represent for the economy as a whole ? If you 're excluding these brilliant students from attending U.S. universities It 's going to make us . It 's going to make us poorer . It 's going to make there be fewer high quality jobs I do n't know , I think most people would rather at the next Google than work assembling an iPhone . And we 're making a choice to become the economy that assembles iPhones , rather than being the economy that invents iPhones . And that 's a very costly , mistake . It 's a misguided , judgment . And ultimately it 's going to be I speak to all kinds of American students . They think that part of what is about coming to a university lik is the way they meet the most talented young people from around the world . So I do n't know who wants to hav that opportunity . denied , to them . What a fantastic opportunity it was for us some years ago to be able to have XI Jinping 's brought up in that system . Carmen spent four years in our system . And what an opportunity that is to show the difference between our society and And we 're just throwing that all"
https://youtu.be/mvqyunEhclo?si=OquX7NAa1UP75MHn,"Trump’s image of dead ‘white farmers’ came from Congo, not South Africa",cnn,mvqyunEhclo,"On to new fallout now from Donald Trump 's contentious Oval Office meeting with South Africa 's president earlier this week . During that meeting , President Trump held up some printouts of news articles and images that he claimed were evidence of a genocide against white South Africans . , as Reuters reports , one of the images is from Reuters video of a mass burial in the Democratic Republic of Congo . It does not depict that white farmers in South Africa , as Mr. Trump and the white House claimed , in front of the South African president and in front of journalists and the white in the white House . For more now , let 's go to CNN 's Larry Meadow , joining us from Nairobi in Kenya . This Congo confusion . Larry , how are people where you are reacting to it ? It is shocking to a lot of people because , as I said after that meeting , based on my own reporting in this region , and especially from 15 years in South Africa , a lot of what President Trump used to justify this persecution and murders of white farmers was just untrue . And this is another evidence . When I saw him hold up that picture , I thought it looked familiar . We now know , and Reuters is confirming that this picture of body bags is not from South Africa . It 's from the Democratic Republic of Congo . It 's from a mass burial in from a mass burial in Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo on February 3rd . And the Reuters video journalist Jaafar al - Khattab , who took that video , was surprised to see the president hold up that picture . It 's a screengrab that links to a Reuters video from that day . It follows a big assault on that Goma city in the eastern DRC by rebels named M23 . And that was the effect a lot of people were killed on that day , in the days before , and this was a mass burial that was carried out by the International Committee of the Red cross . And Reuters was the only news organization that were allowed in to film that . So this picture does not depict the deaths of white farmers in South Africa as President Trump led President Ramaphosa to believe . And the wider question , the point that President Trump was trying to make here is that lots of farmers in South Africa are getting killed or getting executed , even though he used evidence that does not support that . That picture was from an American conservative online magazine that had talked about both Goma , the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa , and the South African foreign minister was on Amanpour last night , and he brought some statistics with him . In the last four years to 125 farmer talks , 101 farm dwellers who are majority black , 55 , farm owners who are majority white . So that is a period of four years . And that does not represent a genocide . And but it is still unfortunate it will need to happen . because any crime , it is a crime . And that 's why the president then stated that we are dealing with the crime situation . And that is the argument the South Africans are trying to make in the Oval Office . They have a crime problem , not a murder of farmers . In fact , farm murders . Last year , when we looked at it , 0.2 % of the overall total , a small percentage . , we 've been here before . Donald Trump and his press folks using material out of context so we can now add South Africa to the list . Larry Mandela , thank you so much for your reporting . More on that contentious meeting between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and President Trump from yesterday afternoon . You 'll remember the white House played a video purporting to back up claims that Afrikaners in South Africa are victims of genocide . Mr. Trump showed a video of crosses lining the side of a road , claiming it was a burial site of murdered white farmers . It was n't . Today , white House press Secretary Carolyn Leavitt was pressed about it . Pressed about the video by NBC reporter Yamiche Alcindor , the president showed a video that he said showed more than a thousand burial sites of white South Africans who he said were murdered . We know that was not true and that the video was n't to . And that 's why I wonder , why did the president choose to show that it 's not ? The video was showing a burial site . It 's unsubstantiated that 's the case . , it 's it 's true that video showed the crosses that represent what the president claimed . The the video showed images of crosses in South Africa about white farmers who have been killed and politically persecuted because of the color of their skin . And those crosses are representing their lives . Those crosses are representing their lives . And in the fact that they are now dead and their government did nothing about it . Are you disputing that there is no fact that the video showed what the president claimed it showed , because it did not show that , but even more . What I 'm asking you is who at the white House show that the white cross is representing people who have perished because of racial persecution . The video that the president shows , and what protocols are in place when there 's unsubstantiated information being put out for the world and world leaders push what 's on substantiated about the video . The video shows crosses that represent the dead bodies of people who were racially persecuted by their government . In fact , the Associated Press , of all places , has a picture of that very monument in the caption from the Associated Press is each cross marks a white farmer who has been killed in a farm murder . So it is substantiated . But it 's not just by that video and the physical evidence that everybody saw on display in the Oval Office , but also by another outlet in this from the Associated Press . So you should take it up with them if you believe the claim is unsubstantiated . And that 's a ridiculous line of questioning . , keeping them honest , it 's not what President Trump said yesterday . Let 's listen to what he said . These are burial sites here . Burial sites . Over a thousand of white farmers . And those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning . Each one of those white things is across and is approximately a thousand of them . They 're all white farmers . The family of white farmers . And those cars are n't driving there . Stop there to pay respects to their family member who was killed . and it 's a terrible sight . I 've never seen anything it . Those people were all killed . Have they told you where that is , Mr. president ? . I 'd to know where that is . Because this I 've never seen . I do n't know , . It 's in South Africa . , the South African president there at the end asking where the burial site is because he 'd never seen it . It 's because it does not exist . It 's not a burial ground . It 's video from five years ago of a vigil created after a white farming couple was robbed and murdered . That was a tragedy as any murder . And the people who killed them were convicted of it . It was not ignored . The killing shook the Afrikaner community , and a neighbor of the couple erected the crosses to honor them and other farmers who had been killed across South Africa . It 's not a burial site , he told the BBC today . The person who made this memorial , it was a memorial . It was not a permanent memorial that was erected . It was a temporary memorial . Now , in addition to the claim of a burial ground , there was an article that President Trump held up as further proof of genocide of white farmers in South Africa . There all these are all white farmers that are being buried . , we tracked down the source of the image in that article , and it 's not from South Africa . It is a screengrab of Reuters video from Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and was from February , when over 2000 people were killed in clashes between the government and a rebel group . Now , the sick irony is that none of the black people fleeing violence or persecution in DRC , Congo or anywhere else in Africa would be allowed into the United States now as refugees . Only white Afrikaners based on claims of a genocide which is not occurring ."

Reacting to President Trump 's new tariff threats issued just this morning as the president took to social media saying that he 's now recommending a 50 % tariff on all goods coming from the European Union as of June 1st , citing a lack of progress in trade talks there . And there 's also more . He 's also threatened threatening Apple now with a 25 % tariff if the company does n't bring iPhone manufacturing back to the US . In my ear , we heard opening Bell happening . That 's happening now . We 're going to keep an eye as the markets open . Claire Duffy is here with me now . So this is what we 're watching . Claire , talk to me about what we 're likely to see with markets today . They 're going to be updating in one second and also at the same time about Apple . Yet . So futures were down as it looks markets are starting to be in the red as you 're seeing there . And this is a concern about the trade war restarting here . Investors have a brief moment . Breathed a sigh of relief during this 90 day pause on most reciprocal tariffs . And now it appears that Trump is trying to exert some more pressure on the EU , threatening these 50 % tariffs . , this 90 day pause was supposed to end in July , but he is now suggesting that this 50 % tariff on the EU go into effect June 1st . That is soon . So I think that 's part of what we 're seeing here . And then of course , there is Apple . I think we 've got Apple stock down almost 3 % now . Apple had tried to move some of its production away from China because of the China tariffs that had moved most of the U.S. iPhones that were getting shipped to the U.S. to India . But Trump is not happy about that . He wants iPhones made in the United States , and that is why he 's threatening this 25 % tariff on Apple . The problem is you have to give the reality of it . Apple will not be moving iPhone production to the U.S. analysts estimate that if it did move iPhone production to the U.S. , it would take 5 to 10 years , and that once that happened , iPhones could cost $ 3,500 . That is three times the amount that they cost today , and consumers just would n't buy that product . Now , Apple has tried to appease Trump in other ways . We 've seen CEO Tim Cook meeting with Trump more than once a number of times since the inauguration . The company has also announced this $ 500 billion investment in other types of U.S. facilities production . But there 's a lot of moving iPhone production to the U.S. some analysts have called it a fiction , a fairy tale . It 's just not going to happen . And what we could see as a result of this 25 % tariff , if it does go into effect , is consumer prices raise . There were already rumors that Apple was going to be raising prices for the new slate of iPhones in the fall . If this 25 % tariff goes into effect , those prices could go up even further . . , , veteran tech analyst Dan Ives , who lot a lot of people lean on for just reality on this , I think , he said , estimating something it would cost $ 30 billion for Apple to move over three years . . Product . . , it is not happening . It 's just not happening . So what the play is here that the pressure that Donald Trump is trying to exert on Tim Cook and Apple now , that 's the TBD because that Trump has to know this reality . And I think the problem here is it 's just creates more uncertainty . And businesses ca n't operate under uncertainty . Absolutely not . It 's great . Thank you so much Claire . We 're going to be obviously watching the market . That 's going to be another big story today . Elena , let me go back to you over at the white House . So the president 's calling out Apple , threatening the company with a new 25 % tariff . Do white House officials acknowledge , at least privately , that this is going to increase the cost of iPhones for American consumers ? I 'm behind closed doors . , , but definitely not in public . And I know myself and other reporters have publicly tried to press white House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt on this . Now , look , this post that the president put up about Apple and its CEO , Tim Cook , he essentially said that he has long warned cook , someone that the president speaks with frequently . I would note that he was here at the white House just a few days ago . Tim Cook met with Donald Trump on Tuesday here . He said that he 's long warned him that he would put this 25 % tariff on iPhones if they did not begin moving the manufacturing of those iPhones to the United States . Now , one thing to note here is , is that most of the manufacturing for iPhones is happens in China . They have begun to move some of the manufacturing to India , noting that it 's a has more favorable relations with Donald Trump . But this is of course , something , as you mentioned , that is going to massively increase the price of iPhones . iPhones in the U.S. are currently $ 1,000 . Experts say that if this goes to plan as Trump wanted , it could begin costing consumers $ 3,500 for iPhones . So something of course , I do n't think a lot of consumers or people in this country would want , but this is something that the president has long been fixated on and has talked about since the beginning of his tariff war . And let me get to you because remind us what 's at stake with these latest threats on the European Union . , Wolf , this would be a major escalation in the trade war . And it is not sitting well with investors . The moment that this true social threat came out , we saw U.S. stock futures fall . And markets are all solidly in the red with the Dow down by 300 points , about three quarters of 1 % , but a 1 % decline for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq as well . And this reaction , I think , makes a lot of sense because investors had been hoping for de - escalation in the trade war . This would be a move in the wrong direction . And it does add a lot of uncertainty , because the European Union is one of America 's biggest trading partners . The US imported more than $ 600 billion in goods from the EU last year alone , including major items such as pharmaceuticals , cars , car parts , aircraft , machinery and alcoholic beverages . As well , massive tariffs would disrupt the flow of trade and sharply increase prices here in the United States . I talked to Mary Lovely . She 's a trade expert over at the Peterson Institute , and she told me this is just going to backfire . She said the EU considers itself to be a major global body . It does not deserve to be treated a small plumbing contractor . And , Wolf , we did reach out to the EU for comment . We have not heard back . But you got to believe if these tariffs do go into effect and that is a big hit . But if they do , you 've got to believe the EU would seriously consider retaliating . And that retaliation is where U.S. jobs could be threatened . They certainly could be that the president , president Trump , is also threatening these new tariffs on Apple unless they start manufacture featuring iPhones here in the United States . . That 's . And let 's take a look at how Apple stock reacting down by 3 % on this threat to impose massive tariffs on Apple unless it moves its production to the United States . Now look this is something that Apple could not do overnight . Of course , this is something that would take 5 to 10 years . And as Jeff mentioned , this is something that would add cost because the cost of labor is just so much higher in the United States . A Wedbush analyst , Dan Ise , he estimates that this would cost iPhones . It would increase the price of an iPhone to $ 3,500 if the iPhone had to be made in the United States . Ives put out a note earlier where he said , we believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible . And one last point here , Wolf . Even if it was economical for Apple to do this , it would be very hard , if not impossible for the company to find enough workers who have the skills and frankly , the desire to make iPhones here in the US . President Trump has also been posting on social about tariffs on Apple . Your perspective on that , because he says he wants Tim Cook iPhones to be manufactured and built in the United States . Shares are down just almost 2 % . 3 % . Pardon me . I think that 's it . That 's clear what the idea behind it is to get more manufacturing production again back to the US . So from the president 's point of view , I think this makes sense . So this is a measure to really then bring back manufacturing to the U.S .. It would come at the cost of US consumers because what does it mean . It would push up prices enormously . Even if you were to produce in the US , this would also mean higher production costs for any company that currently produces partly in Asia . So this means , , it could eventually bring manufacturing jobs back to the US , but U.S. consumers would have to pay a higher price for that . . And are they prepared to pay to pay three times their current price ? I 'm not sure about that . Carsten , appreciate coming on this breaking news . Thank you very much indeed ."

Together , they appear to show Russian forces executing a group of Ukrainian soldiers who had just surrendered . See those bodies there ? It comes as a cease fire appears to be even further away after Trump 's two hour call with Vladimir Putin . Nick Paton Walsh is OutFront tonight with this investigation . I want to warn you , it does include graphic video . What is it ? , you do n't see this . This was before even this moment of surrender . The fate of these six Ukrainian troops was sealed . Ukrainian drone images from the southern front last November show the horror that comes after defeat . A Russian hiding in the bushes shoots one Ukrainian in the head . Ukrainian officials gave CNN intercepts of Russian radio orders from their commanders to their troops here . we ca n't verify them independently , but they help paint a chilling picture of what appear to be executions , to order of a plan to kill prisoners given from above . The Russian in the bushes seems to fit a mask and then emerge . He 's joined by another Russian . They talk . There 's no physical threat from their prisoners . And one captive Ukrainian seems to gesture at them . But nothing changes his fate . Shot in the head , calmly , another Ukrainian gets up , presumably the commander , and takes off his armor . But the voice on the radio is impatient . The commander is led away in total six times the order to kill was given . According to the intercepts . A forensic study for CNN , the files and audio found no reason they were n't authentic , and a Western intelligence official described them to us as , , credible . We have geolocated the footage of the killing to this tree line just outside of North America , in Zaporizhzhia region , where fierce fighting raged late last year . Ukrainian prosecutors say the executions of surrendering Ukrainian troops by Russians are increasing . They say they opened eight cases in all of 2023 . 39 for all of last year and in just the first four months of this year . 20 it 's a well - coordinated and well - planned policy and execution of prisoners of war , as well as other war crimes which have been committed in Ukraine . I think that 's goes up to the to the president of Russian Federation . Another video supplied to CNN by a Western intelligence official shows a similar scene , also from Zaporizhzhia . Ukrainians are surrounded and surrendering to Russians with red tape on their helmets . But two others joined them . White tape on their helmets . They appear to use their radios , and then a white helmet opens fire . As the smoke clears . A red reloads his weapon and shoots another Ukrainian in the head . There 's no radio intercept here , but a Western intelligence official told CNN the order to kill likely came from the white to the red killings aimed at hitting Ukrainian morale , but also cynically just easing Russian logistics . A stark window into Moscow 's mindset . Surrender means nothing , and mercy is not an option . That is incredibly difficult to watch . Nick . And it 's incredible reporting . I know you 're in Kyiv tonight . , what else are you learning about these stunning images ? What they 're saying , is it Russia killing ? And it appears to be very commonplace . Soldiers who have surrendered . . , what 's rare about this evidence here is that it seems to match the specific radio orders given by Russia 's command to the drone images of those executions . Now , images those have been popping up across the front lines . We first reported on them last year . But to hear the specific command certainly evidentially here legally , you might also argue as well , adds the severity of the allegations here . You heard saw that the numbers that now talking about Ukraine struggling with at the beginning , I think making some of these public because of the impact it might have upon morale chilling to hear the fact this might sometimes simply be a logistical matter of making sure they have n't got captives to try and manage and organize . We 've reached out to Russia 's Minister of Defense for comment , and they have n't responded . Senior officials have said in the past that they treat prisoners in accordance with international law and denied allegations this . But we 've also spoken to the United Nations Special rapporteur for extrajudicial killings , who said to CNN this would not happen with such numbers and frequency without orders , or at least the consent from the highest military commanders , which in Russia means the presidency . So significant allegations made to signs of a troubling policy . And another sign , really , of the limitless nature of what Russia 's willing to do to secure a victory here in an incredible reporting and incredible , as you say , that , that something this could go all the way to Putin himself . Thank you so much , Nick , in Kyiv tonight ."

It comes as the school 's officials refuse to give in to the administration 's policy demands . As CNN 's Jeff Zeleny reports , this move could impact more than a quarter of Harvard 's student body . The Trump administration is dramatically escalating its fight , with Harvard University saying on Thursday that all international students will be banned from continuing their education at Harvard , saying all students must change their enrollment to another university or lose their legal status to be in the United States . Now , the backstory to all of this . This comes as the fight with Harvard began earlier this year . Initially , the administration blocking some $ 2 billion or so in funding federal funding to Harvard programs . This comes as the administration is trying to get Harvard to change its curriculum . They say that the university has been dominated by D - I programs , anti - Semitic protests and the . The white House in a statement saying this Harvard has turned their once great institution into a hotbed of anti - American , anti - Semitic , pro terrorist agitators . The white House says enrolling foreign students is a privilege , not a . Harvard University , of course , pushing back strongly on this , saying the government 's action is unlawful . Harvard says the retaliatory action threatened serious harm to the Harvard community . Our country and undermines Harvard 's academic and research mission . So the bottom line to this is the , this will certainly end up in a legal proceeding . add it to the list of administration , proposals that have been challenged by court . But this is a lot of students we are talking about here . Some 27 % of Harvard 's entire student body , about 6700 students would fall under this . So , of course , this has a big fallout for those students already here in the U.S. as a school . semester nears an end . Jeff Zeleny , CNN , the white House . And joining us now is Harvard president emeritus , Larry Summers . He was also , of course , Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration . Mr. Secretary , it is great to have you here . Grateful for your time . after this news came out on Thursday , you wrote on X that the Trump administration 's vendetta action against Harvard is now over the top , and that it 's crazy to make enemies of thousands of the most talented young people from around the world . You 're saying that there needs to be due process here , but what recourse does Harvard have at the moment ? We 've got three branches of government in the United States , and they 're independent and co - equal . The executive that 's the president , the legislative that 's the Congress and the judicial . I can not imagine that singling out one university , as opposed to all other universities for sanction of this kind and attacking that university without due process , without an indication of what specifically the problem is with a set of punishments and sanctions that are mostly going to fall on people whose fault is surely is n't people who dreamed of coming to the United States to study , to absorb American traditions , to advance science , and now are having their lives wrecked , their whole clan being taken asunder ? I ca n't believe that is legal . And I would hope that the university will take legal action and that there 'll be some judicial action that sets this wrong ? , let 's talk about those people that you are referring to . , few people know Harvard better than you do . I want you to tell us about the international student body on campus and how they fit into the community . And is it even possible for you to imagine a Harvard University without its international students ? I ca n't Harvard has n't been that way for hundreds of years . I know this the United States won World War two , in no small part because of what foreign scholars at American universities did . The Manhattan Project radar so many other fundamental innovations . I know this we would n't have met the pandemic in the way we did , without all kinds of people from abroad who came to American universities and helped discover the vaccines . I know this we would n't have the prosperity that we have without people who came , were drawn to the United States by the opportunity to study at great universities , Harvard , and went on to found , great companies to get patents that were the basis for pervasive , innovation . So , Secretary Summers , , the school is in the position that it is in now because it has really stood up to the Trump administration in ways that , , many other elite institutions have n't . Have you agreed with the way that the school has been handling its clash with the administration ? Look , I believe there 's a lot that needs to change at Harvard . There are issues about identity politics . There are issues about anti - Semitism . There are issues about not enough spectrum of , views , but I believe is the course for Harvard is resist and reform . . Reform . But , , we now have a government that is trying to bring law firms that represent certain defendants . It does n't to their knees . That is sending people out of the country , even American citizens , without any due process protections . That court after court after court has found to be in violation of the law regarding , federal spending powers by cutting off what Congress has ordered . This is the beginnings . Not all the way there . It 's all wrong to compare this to Hitler and say some of the overheated things that people say , but these are steps away from democracy and towards tyranny . And if an institution with all Harvard 's resource is an endowment of more than $ 50 billion , all its prestige , its incredible network of alumni , presidents , Nobel Prize winners , chief executive officers , great artists . If Harvard ca n't resist the steps towards tyranny , who can ? So I salute our current president , Alan Garber , for his courage and steadfastness . And I believe we are doing what is , what is necessary , and is just immensely important to the American future . Larry Summers , thank you so much for sharing your very unique perspective on this story with us . Thank you ."

Aaron . every other case where Donald Trump 's retaliation has been tested in court over 150 times , courts have reje The same thing will happen here .

That never works with a blackmai What does work is going to court That 's what they should do here . And that 's the flip side . Aaron . This is very upsetting and diffi but it 's also an opportunity for Harvard and its students to stand up for democracy . This is going to impact a lot of students at Harvard . Je Pamela . It certainly is at the moment , this is just the latest example of the ongoing escalation between the white House , the Trump administration and , Harvard University . But , this afternoon , the Trump administration , through , Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is , is telling Harvard that they can no longer enroll international students . the white House telling me just a few moments ago , enrolling , foreign students is a privilege . It 's not a . so Kristi Noem , in her letter to Harvard outlined so what she says is an unsafe for conditions on c promoting anti - Semitic , behavior and demonstrations . Of course , this is the ongoing , the latest chapter in the ongoin which has been about school funding , about the curriculum . Now it 's about international stu But , Harvard is vowing to push b They say that this is unlawful . And they said that they will cha this in law . But , Pamela , what we 're talking about here is about 27 % of the , studen at Harvard , are international st That was in this academic year , some 6700 students or so . And the government now is saying that all of these stud must either , leave Harvard and transfer to another institution or lose their legal status to study here in the U.S. so we will see where this goes . This is one more example of a ca that will be fought out , legally But it 's just an escalation . And Harvard , of course , has been one of the few institutions that really fought back against the administration , against the Trump administration , largely because they have the largest endowment university . But , a dramatic escalation of this ongoing fight here that leaves many students as they near the end of their , semester here , a bit in uncertain , terrain and a territory . Pamela , there certainly in limbo those foreign students . Jeff Zeleny , thank you so much . Let 's bring back the panel on th And , Congressman , I want to go t because I believe you went to Ha Is that Harvard Law School ? . What 's your reaction to th it 's it 's silly and ridiculous and illegal , I think , in a couple of ways . One is , I do n't think they have the authority to do th I do n't really see what the legal hook would be . And based on what Noam just said I do n't really hear a legal basi for that . But in addition to that , this is a big , existential piece from an economic standpoint for Harvard and many other institutions , too So they certainly have the incen to fight this , , to the last dog is dead , so to speak . And also , , it 's another ding on the soft power aspect , one of th the really great things about having this huge , extensive international alumni network is that a lot of these people are in countries around t and they have , relationships here in the United We have relationships with them which work very well sometimes in some of these international d And this is another example of the Trump administration burning that bridge needlessly . Why would the best and the brigh in other parts of the world want to come study in the in the if something this could hap Well , one , I think they 're going to continu we 're still the beacon we provid regardless of the president , as we attract more legal immigra than any other country in the wo about a million every year , four times more than the next cl country out there . So I think we 'll continue to be But let 's be clear , particularly in light of what 's here in the last 24 hours , I want Harvard and every other campus to be saf for Jewish students as well as any other students . Christian , whether it 's faith , tradition  So I think it 's really important to focus . At Young America 's Foundation , we see that with Jewish students Christian students concerns , students overwhelmingl feel threatened allied to these So there needs to be a reckoning about that . That said , I think there 's going to have to some significant changes here just as we saw I remember in the first term as a group of governors of both parties got together , we were talking to the president at that time . He was talking about a muslim ban on travel . That was not the case in the in the actual language the Department of Homeland Secur talked about was targeted towards countries that , under th administration of President Obam had been identified as not providing information . It was n't a blanket . For example , Indonesia was free and able to free people and even that 's the largest Muslim population in the world . So I think you 're going to see some significant changes to make this anything close to t Unfortunately , . But at the end of the day , what they are doing is trying to make Harva bend the knee . This is not about protecting Jewish students , and this is not about protecting , international students from not being safe . This is about the federal govern trying to impose its will on an independent instituti which Harvard is . And it is the most prominent ins not only in America , but in the And by targeting Harvard , they 're sending a message to uni all across this country about what will be tolerated and what wo n't be in this admini And , , the dirty little secret is international students are full and tuition . And this is trust me , it 's a lot of DC universities he that are watching this very clos because this is a finance this is targeting Harvard financ and by the way this is a this becomes financially existen And this ends up having a derivative impact in that the international payers are who subsidize sometimes Americans who do n't have the resources to go to Harvard that Harvard ca So this is the balancing act that universities use . And a lot , particularly on the E and on the two coasts , use the international students as a way to and the federal government gets a hold to it , . Try to take away tax exempt stat So this is an attack financially it feels and th I tend to agree with where you 're going here , which is they 're just trying to get him to get have this conversation ."
https://youtu.be/KVafWWBJy7g?si=Uis_Tp3LQwBrKaGI,Trump administration revokes Harvard from enrolling any international students,cnn,KVafWWBJy7g,"We do have breaking news now . The Trump administration has just revoked Harvard University 's ability to enroll any international students . The existing international students there have to transfer out and no new ones can be accepted in . This marks a sharp escalation in the ongoing battle between the white House and the nation 's oldest university . CNN 's Jeff Zeleny is at the white House . Jeff , tell us what 's happening here . , Brianna and Boris , there has been an ongoing fight between the white House and Harvard University over the curriculum , over the federal funding , and now over international students . As you said , this is a dramatic escalation . We are learning this announcement from the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem , making the announcement this afternoon . Essentially giving a warning to Florida that they are no longer allowed to admit international students . As she writes this , in part , they have lost their student and exchange visitor program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law . She says , let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country . So let 's break that down a touch . she 's accusing them , Harvard University , of failing to adhere to the law . Of course , there were some , rules essentially , that were put out as a , strings , if you will , on federal funding for what type of a curriculum ? universities , could use , what type of D - I programs they could and could n't have . Of course , this all stems from , protests on college campuses . Harvard University is pushing back very hard at this . Just a statement coming out just a few moments ago . Harvard is , is saying that they will , challenge this . So legally as well . And they go on to say this , the government 's , action is unlawful . Harvard says we are fully committed to maintaining Harvard 's ability to host international students and scholars who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university and this nation immeasurably . So how many students are we talking about here ? , in this academic year alone , almost 30 % of Harvard 's a student body , were made up of international students , as some as , 6793 , according to this year 's academic record . So the government is saying that these students must transfer . We were told that they are likely to be able to transfer to another U.S. institution , not necessarily , return to their home countries . But of course , this will be , one of the many , actions of this administration that will be challenged legally , but certainly , once again , a dramatic escalation from the U.S. government against Harvard or some . Brianna , certainly , as Jeff Zeleny , thank you . And with us now to discuss is Ryan Enos , the professor of government at Harvard University . He 's also a member of Harvard 's chapter of the American Association of University Professors , which is currently suing the Trump administration . professor , thank you for being with us . this , a decision that Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students and existing foreign students have to transfer or lose their legal status . what 's your reaction to this ? I think it 's awful and it 's outrageous . It 's another pattern of the Trump administration taking authoritarian actions in the United States . The president does not have the power to punish people , target people for punishment because he does n't their politics . And he 's targeted Harvard because he thinks he politically disagrees with them . It 's a political vendetta . And he 's doing this on the back of students who were admitted to Harvard from around the world for their merit , for things that they accomplished in life . And now he 's trying to punish them , to hold them hostage , essentially , and essentially to try to win what he considers to be this political fight with Harvard , that 's what authoritarians do , is not done by the rule of law . Secretary Noam says the administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence , anti - Semitism and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus . What do you say to that ? I see you shaking your head . . , I could shake my head all day against those things . I would ask them what violence they 're pointing to , what anti - Semitism they 're pointing with , what coordination with the Chinese Communist Party to point to . These are outrageous statements . And I think it 's become increasingly clear that the public does n't believe these . The American public does n't believe this . And and they 're leveling these outrageous claims to try to win this political battle and that in a certain respect , I think we see this pattern with them . It does n't matter whether these accusations they are making are true . They 're all a pretext of , a pretext for this , trying to punish Harvard and punish other universities as a way to bring them under their control . And as I said earlier , that is what authoritarians do is not the way things should be done in the United States . Some some of this may come down to what particular free speech may be allowed . But this Secretary is also citing Harvard 's own report . Harvard released two reports last month on anti - Israel bias , and there was another one on anti - Muslim , anti - Arab and Anti - Palestinian bias , finding in part that Jewish students had faced bias , suspicion , intimidation , alienation , shunning , contempt and sometimes affective exclusion from various curricular and co - curricular parts of the university community . It also found that Arab , Muslim and Palestinian students and faculty who voiced concern over rising death tolls in Gaza and the unfolding humanitarian crisis there , overwhelmingly felt abandoned , and some believed they were actively silenced by Harvard administrators . what work do you think Harvard has to do , on these issues ? , Harvard is a big , diverse place , bringing people together from across the world , and from different communities across the United States and putting them in a place where they live together , and they study together and they work together . And then when things happen in the world , happened in Gaza and happened in Israel , are going to touch our community . And of course , people are just going to disagree . And sometimes this can lead to things that should n't happen , shunning and , , people yelling at each other , whatever type of things we want to cite in those reports , and those are things we need to sort out and we need to we need to make happen less because we 're an academic community . And ultimately we should be trying to construct , find constructive ways to bridge our disagreements . They are not the type of things that would lead to some extreme response , banning international students , which I should mention would include Israeli students from coming to Harvard . That does n't make people agree . It does n't make these issues of disagreement that happen in a diverse community go away . And so we 'll keep working on those things at Harvard . That 's part of what makes Harvard a great institution , is we find ways to constructively deal with our differences , which we do have . But it 's not the type of thing that will be solved by authoritarian attacks on our international students . the administration is making it clear here that part of , , this punishment is about a financial effect on Harvard , that foreign students , and pay higher tuition payments , says helped pad multi - billion dollar endowments . What do you think that the administration is trying to do here financially to Harvard ? They 're looking for another way to punish Harvard . , foreign students , they do n't just contribute to Harvard because of the money they bring into tuition . And we should be very clear about that . They they contribute to Harvard because these are the best students in the world that are coming to the United States and bringing their talents in a way that benefits not just Harvard , but the American people . And they make our community richer . Many of them , through their intellectual contributions , many of them stay in the United States and help our economy and help our communities . And what the Trump administration is ultimately trying to do is take that away , not just from Harvard , but from the American people that these foreign students benefit . This is one of the great things about the United States is that people come from all over the world to study here . It 's an incredible blessing , and it 's something that no other country has where the smartest people in the world come to our institutions to study . And ultimately , that punishment is n't just going to Harvard . It 's going to the United States has taken away a great resource that has built up through these universities Harvard ."

But I ca n't do that because I 'm here to deliver a dose of reality . This bill dramatically increases deficits in the near term , but promises our government will be fiscally responsible five years from now . Where have we heard that before ? How do you bind a future Congress to these promises ? This bill is a debt bomb ticking . Mr. speaker , we 're not rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic tonight . We 're putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg . If something is . If something is beautiful . If something is beautiful , you do n't do it after midnight . I oppose this . Time has expired . After a long night of very intense debate on the House floor , lawmakers have finally passed President Trump 's sweeping tax and spending cuts bill . That was in the House . Now it goes to the Senate . Republicans in the House unveiled a slew of changes to the massive legislation to win over several GOP holdouts , but they did n't convince everyone . Two GOP House members still voted against the measure , while another voted present . It 's a big win for the House speaker , Mike Johnson , who had vowed to get the bill passed before Memorial Day . It 's truly historic . The media , the Democrats , have consistently dismissed any possibility that House Republicans would get pissed off , that they did not believe that we could succeed in our mission to enact President Trump 's America First agenda . But this is a big one . And once again , they 've been proven wrong . Today , the House has passed a generation of truly nation shaping legislation , and now it 's up to the Senate to see what they decide . Let 's go live to Capitol Hill now . CNN 's chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju is standing by . Manu , what 's first of all in this House , Bill , and how will it affect Americans ? , this is a sweeping bill , really dealing with a wide range of issues . Everything from changes on immigration laws , more money for the border security measures , as well as more money to try to improve , increase the U.S. defense posture . But very significantly , a massive overhaul of the United States tax code , an increase it would permanently extend the 2017 Trump era tax cuts , but also add new provisions dealing with taxes on tips . Changes on state and local taxes are deducted , and then spending cuts . Major spending cuts to domestic programs , including on issues food stamps as new work requirements and for those food stamp benefits , new work requirements for Medicaid recipients as well . That would kick in at the end of 2026 . A whole slew of changes that would did not go far enough for a number of those hard line members who wanted much more in terms of spending because they were concerned , Wolf , about the deficit impacts from this proposal . In fact , this proposal is expected to increase the deficit by nearly $ 4 trillion over the next several years . That is according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . And that is what a number of these hardline members had said to me going into the vote so that they could not support something this , but they ultimately changed their mind because under pressure from Donald Trump and from the speaker of the House and facing this vote , they decided that they were going to accept what they ultimately could get in the bill and accept the fact that they could n't get everything was in place . We have been focused on this moment for a long time , and I think that there 's is there 's there 's a moment where you just take a collective pause and say , we 've accomplished a lot . And so , we just have been we 've been heads down in this fight for so long . What about the impact on the deficit ? , there 's CBO suggests this could be trillions of dollars in the next several years . That 's that 's accurate . And I do n't that one debt , but I do n't know what else what the other option is now . So where does this go from here ? That 's a that is the question facing Republicans because now it did . It passed the House by the narrowest of margins . The United States Senate will have its turn to move ahead . Republican senators have their own ideas . Some of them are concerned about those cuts on Medicaid . Some of them are concerned about the how it 's dealing with so - called green energy tax credits . It would phase out a lot of those green energy tax credits that were enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act . That has caused ample concern from some members who are worried about the impacts on their states and their districts . Look for Republicans to try to change that as well . So how does this ultimately play out ? It remains to be seen , because Republicans plan to change it . Can they get the votes out of the Senate ? There 's still concerns on the Senate side about how all this is dealt with . And then they to kick it back to the house for final approval . So there 's some time left here , but no doubt about it , a big win for the speaker a big win for the president in getting the first major step done . After days and weeks of painstaking negotiations , now it 's up to the Senate to see what they decide to do . That could be intense as well . Manu Raja , thank you very , very much . Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Becca Belmont of Vermont . Thank you so much for being here . Look , Republicans have a very clear message this morning with the passage of this bill that now goes to the Senate . Their messages , we can get things done . So what is the Democrat 's message to voters as 2026 is around the corner ? Look , this bill made steep cuts to food assistance programs , to Medicaid . And we also learned in the last 48 hours that because of the increase in the deficit , which is huge , that it also puts at risk Medicare . I have a hard time believing that senators are going to fall in line , especially when you have Senator Josh Hawley saying in recent days , we should not be touching Medicaid . For me , this is a moral line . It makes no sense in this time of incredible struggle in this country , when families are having such a hard time making ends meet to go after food assistance and Medicaid , it will also impact rural hospitals . And I know senators care deeply about that . It 's not just in Vermont . It 's in every rural district across the state . I 'm hearing that from my health care providers . This would be disastrous for them . So the speaker can say whatever he would . But I have a hard time believing that senators are not going to take an ax to this bill . There was an estimated 8 million recipients who could lose Medicare coverage if this particular bill goes through . The Republicans keep saying , , it 's only the people who can work , and it 's only to get them to work . It is not going to affect anyone else . How do it in the reading of this bill ? , that 's just not true . We know it 's not true . We have seen the scores . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has laid it out for us . It 's absolutely not true that it 's only the people , they say , who are n't working . And let 's be clear , it 's not just the cuts directly to Medicaid . It is also the fact that they are not continuing the provisions that would allow people who got insurance because of Obamacare to continue that insurance . Millions and millions of people are at risk of losing their health care . And we know that is not popular with Americans . Donald Trump is calling it a big , beautiful bill . I know Democrats are calling a big ugly bill . Is there anything in this bill that you can get behind , perhaps the extremely popular item to eliminate taxes on overtime pay ? Look , the that no tax on tips provision was already passed in the Senate as a standalone bill . And so I think it 's the wrong question to ask whether is there anything in there that I could agree with . This was not a compromise bill . This was a Republican bill from beginning to end . It was shoved through the House in the middle of the night . I was up last night making a speech at three in the morning , and our budget committee met in the middle of the night on Sunday night . It was pushed through . It was not a compromise bill . And for me , there 's a moral line here . You do not cut food assistance and Medicaid and risk Medicare to deliver tax relief to people who do n't need it . Tax relief for the wealthiest among us . The argument is that it extends the 2017 tax relief , which did , , help some families . , what do you say to people who say , , , I do n't want my taxes to increase , so let 's talk about that . What if we were to come together and pass a tax bill that was directed at the working people of this country and the middle class people of this country , and allow the billionaires to do just fine the way they are without giving them an additional handout ? It is not true to say that this is giving a lot of money to the poorest among us . This would amount to $ 1 a day in tax relief . And if you make under $ 20,000 , you are going to see in the combination of your wages and your benefits being cut . This is going to be a loss to you and your family . Congresswoman Becca , thank you so much . I know your passion is out there . This bill heading to the Senate , and then it has to come back to the House or has to be wrangled again . We will see what happens . That is the process . And I know it very well . And we 'll probably have you back talking about it back then . Thank you so much . Appreciate it ."
https://youtu.be/Hydw2ihLJ0A?si=4miligqS4qwiSLuO,"Business jet crashes into San Diego neighborhood, setting homes and cars on fire",cnn,Hydw2ihLJ0A,"We have some breaking news that we want to share with you . We are learning more about that small plane that has crashed into a San Diego neighborhood . Officials say about 15 homes , and now you 're looking at those homes that were impacted when this plane crashed into this neighborhood . We know about 15 homes have been impacted . Look at the damage at that home . And just look at that street with all the debris there that you can see as well . That appears to be a part of the plane . Perhaps a door . as we are looking at this in the middle of , , a local neighborhood . And it was at 6 a.m .. Let 's get to CNN 's Paulo Sandoval . This is a very early time there in San Diego when all of this happened . Certainly people at home . Do we know of any injuries or deaths at this point ? Not quite . Sara , in the next few minutes , we do expect to hear from officials as they are expected to host a press conference to hopefully update us on what we know about this very early morning small plane crash that occurred . It 's going to be just northeast of San Diego . And to your point , Sara , these are just harrowing images where the charred remains of vehicles on a suburban street . And I think it 's important to really just appreciate just a sense of what the potential impact here . While we wait to hear more about any potential injuries or worse , what we know at this point , coming straight from San Diego authorities , that this small plane crashed in the Murphy Canyon neighborhood nearby , there are a lot of military neighborhoods , according to what we 're seeing and hearing from those on the ground . And we do know that as many as 15 homes , according to the assistant fire chief , may have been affected . Now , whether or not to this extent that here , that 's yet to be determined , but you just see what took place on this street corner alone in these large pickup trucks and large vehicles , essentially tossed around and then charred . That certainly gives you a sense of perhaps the force of this , of this impact . Again , this was a small private plane , according to what we have heard so far , possibly a Cessna model . And we do know again that there were at least three streets that are being evacuated . There . And also interesting , in the last 30 minutes , the San Diego Police Department put out a social media post asking for anybody in the neighborhood to call them called or non - emergency number if they smell any fuel , any jet fuel , or if they see any debris at their in their properties . So that also gives you a sense that investigators now are spanning out in all directions , trying to recover any evidence it could be telling as to what may have , may had led to this , to this plane crash . But again , still no word on any injuries or worse after the small plane crashed in the middle of a San Diego neighborhood very early this morning , that small plane that crashed in a neighborhood in San Diego . A news conference with experts now underway . Let 's listen in since it was here to give you more information . Dan ? Eddie . San Diego fire . So crews arrived on scene . The initial crews that found multiple houses and cars on fire . We had reports of a plane that had , crashed in the neighborhood . It was unknown whether it was a military or private plane . when they got on scene , they initiated quick attack of the fire and upgraded this to what we call an alert five , which is a plane off the field , followed by a second alarm . So we had enough units on scene . we were able to work with San Diego PD , evacuate homes across the region . As we came through here , and evacuate everything to the south of us . We 're able to knock down those fires at this time . now , we were able to say that no one was transported from the scene . So we do n't have anybody that was transported off the scene , which is great news for us on this one . Fire was knocked down . We do have one stubborn car fire that will not go on out to the south of us . So if you do see little with the smoke behind there , that 's what that 's from . at this time , we 're continuing to fight the fire on that car fire . Everything else is out from the homes down , down the way . We have , multiple crews that will be on scene doing decon and investigating . FAA is also on scene , and we 're working in conjunction with them . And San Diego PD to ensure that everything is searched , including the homes and everything that is the planes itself . we expect to be out here for 4 to 6 hours at least , doing the investigation part of it until we pass it along . and then moving forward , we 'll be here through the rest of the 24 hour period . I 'm going to pass it off to you , Police Chief Scott Wall . good morning . first I want to start by saying , our heartfelt condolences to the families that are impacted by this terrible incident . from the police department side , our objectives were , very simple . Scene control , traffic control and evacuations . We had officers from throughout the city that responded , we had over 50 officers that were able to get here within minutes . we started evacuating , all of the homes that were impacted , we had an evacuation center up at Miller Elementary . We have close to 100 people that have been displaced and are up there . we 've locked all the streets down . Essentially , Santo Road south of arrow is still closed and will be for the next few hours . and on into the day . and we 're going to continue working collaboratively . I want to commend all of the first responders , that were out here this morning . Fire department , the police department , I ca n't quite put words to describe what this scene looks . but with the jet fuel going down the street , and everything on fire all at once , it was pretty horrific to see , for the police officers and firefighters to run in there , start trying to evacuate people out of the way and doing anything and everything they could to try to save somebody 's life . is really heroic . and again , I 'm going to end with saying , heartfelt condolences to the families that were impacted by this . And with that , we introduce , Mayor Todd Gloria . Bacon cheap . also want to extend , the condolences of the city of San Diego to , the passengers aboard the planes families on the ground . we will be continuing to keep you all posted , throughout the day as more information becomes available . and but what I can tell you now , is that we have had an extraordinary response effort here , led by , San Diego Fire Rescue Department , the San Diego Police Department . but you have what you 've seen is a collaborative effort with county , state and federal partners , as well as our partners , in the community . we have representation here from , the Red cross , the City of Humane Society , and other key partners that are making sure that those are impacted here on the ground , have the support they need . and that 's what I want to say is that , our city , will be supporting these families who are impacted here . they are part of the military community that makes up , our city , the proud partners of our community . and we will support them for as long as it takes to make sure that we get back to good here in Tierra Santa . Appreciate it . that early , communication from , Navy Region southwest and Admiral , Brad Rosen , who 's , extraordinary partner for our city . I also want to note , Councilman Raul Campo , is monitoring the situation very , very closely . Will be out here later today . but we 're all going to be together , make sure that the situation is buttoned up . again , extraordinary effort by our first responders . I ca n't emphasize that enough . the limitation in terms of the additional damage on the ground is DIRECtrillionESULT of their hard work , their expertise and their professionalism . I think every San Diegan , expresses our appreciation , to these heroes who got the job done this morning . it 's still a tragedy . And again , our hearts are with those who are impacted . will continue to be here throughout , this response effort . Make sure , again , the families who are impacted , those are not able to access their homes . our will support it until they 're able to get back into their homes . I said , as I mentioned , this has been a collaborative effort . we are , on military , property . these are military families , military housing . and here , on behalf of Navy to Southwest , is the commanding officer for , Naval base captain , Bob Healy . Captain Healy . All there . You heard officials in San Diego give an update on that small plane crash and the neighborhood there . , the images are just incredible . You saw homes and cars scorched from that plane crash . but they did say that no one was transported from the scene . Still certainly devastation there . , people had to be evacuated from their homes . A lot of the members of the military , Wolf , my husband lived just a mile from there when he was in the military . , that is where a lot of military members , live . But , as here , , FIRStrillionESPONDERS had to act quick this morning . There was Jeff Ewell . They described just going down the street . They had to put out the fires . They said there 's one stubborn fire still going on now in one of the cars . But again , no one transported from the scene can only imagine what it will be your home . And all of a sudden the plane crashes and you look at that roof , look at that roof destroyed plane crashes into your home . Horrific , terrible situation indeed will stay on top of the story ."
https://youtu.be/I7JHBqPyeY4?si=83HZfh8rujAyEufe,House narrowly passes Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill,cnn,I7JHBqPyeY4,"We 're looking now at the House floor . I have sat through many of these votes as if , as have , watching those numbers , tick along . We see one president , which I think we 're going to learn who that was . but in the end , Democrats more or less held together . Nobody broke . we 're going to take a listen . On this vote , the ayes are 215 . The nays are 214 , with one answering present . The bill is passed . We ask you for so we can see , House speaker Mike Johnson there . And a lot of applause from Republicans in this moment . As Doug said , that was a fractured caucus on the way to this process . Andy Harris from Maryland , a hard liner was the present vote . That 's when he 's going to have to explain , not just to the president , but to his constituents . So I want to talk about this as even just I 'll call it a victory for the House speaker , because there was a time where it felt no Republican speaker could survive even the most basic votes or process , and , he 's managed to do that . That 's true . And this was a speaker that came pretty much from nowhere after the chaos after the ouster of , speaker McCarthy . and I think he has confounded the expectations of so many people in building a knitting this very fractious Republican coalition together . But I think your point is a good one . a lot of the things that he had to put in this bill to get it through the House by that one vote , they 're going to be very problematic for certain Republican senators , some that are running for reelection . when it comes back , it 's going to be really interesting to see what it looks . What pressure does this put on the Senate now ? . Because there is going to be a lot of conversations , as they , reconcile . . part of the legislation . What do you think , folks are going to be pointing to talking about , Medicaid for sure . We 've already seen op eds have been written by Republican Senate leaders . in the , in their , in their , local newspapers as well as in the New York Times later yesterday , because they recognize that this is going to shut down health care , it is going to eradicate the already fragile health care system in many of their districts , particularly because there is a larger percentage of Medicaid recipients who reside in districts than anyplace else . So I think that for them , they 're paying attention because they know that this is going to have an effect on midterms . But moreover , their state can not afford to lose that level of coverage . . Can you talk about that one constant in Washington is that regardless of party , the House and the Senate usually do not see eye to eye on , this is certainly going to play out over the coming weeks when they come back from the Memorial Day recess . . You 're looking at high fives on the House floor , people taking pictures with the House speaker . The reason being the breaking news . House Republicans just pushed President Trump 's domestic agenda a big step forward , passing the massive tax cuts and spending bill after marathon meetings and deep internal divisions that we 've talked so much about among House Republicans themselves , the House speaker , Mike Johnson , managing to keep United almost all House Republicans behind these sweeping spending bill after , the one the Rules Committee meeting lasted almost 22 hours . Two Republicans voted against the measure . There are big changes that were made in these marathon meetings overnight that made it capable to get the bill to this point , to the floor and now headed over to the Senate . CNN 's Loren Fox is on Capitol Hill following all of this for us . Loren , how did we get from there to here and what now ? It 's been a really remarkable 24 hours on Capitol Hill , especially for House speaker Mike Johnson , who had set this incredibly ambitious deadline of getting this bill out of the House of Representatives by Memorial Day weekend . Now , so many of his members even were skeptical that this was going to be possible . Yesterday morning , you had members of the House Freedom Caucus saying that they needed another 7 to 10 days to negotiate in order to pass this bill , arguing that this deadline was really arbitrary , that the speaker was trying to speed this up too quickly , and yet the speaker was able to just get this finish , the speaker still on the floor , receiving high fives , hugs , people trying to get photographs with him as they are celebrating this victory . Republicans winning this vote 215 to 214 . There were still two Republican holdouts , Thomas Massie and Warren Davidson , who voted against this bill because of concerns that it is adding too much to the country 's deficit . But still , this is a huge victory where Speaker Johnson was able to bring some of the moderates together , some of those swing district New York Republicans together and members of the House Freedom Caucus . And he did this in a couple of different ways . One , he gave the House Freedom Caucus what they wanted , which was expediting how quickly work requirements for Medicaid went into effect . He also moved up the deadline for how quickly some of the energy tax credits expired from that period where Joe Biden had passed his own reckoning bill . And then , of course , for some of those New York moderates , there was an increase in how much people in their districts can deduct in state and local taxes . So this was a huge effort where every single move you make as a Republican leader , you 're going to win some votes and you 're going to lose some votes on the other side . So a very delicate negotiation . But I said 24 hours ago , this seemed improbable given the fact that a number of House conservatives were hemming and hawing about the fact that they needed more time to negotiate . I will say that usually on Capitol Hill , when you put a deadline into effect and start moving toward it , Republicans had to make a very difficult decision . Where they going to vote against Donald Trump 's agenda or not ? I just spoke with one of the conservatives who had been a holdout over the weekend , and they told me Donald Trump did make a big difference here . His legislative team made a big difference here . But ultimately , speaker Mike Johnson , who so many of his colleagues say is an extremely patient , thoughtful , slow moving , even when things start to feel they 're building , he does n't lose his temper . They said that was really key to this . Democrats obviously deeply frustrated about this bill passing , warning about the coverage losses that could come from health care , warning about how much this is adding to the country 's deficit , but a very big victory this morning for speaker Mike Johnson . . . And I 'm seeing behind you the minority leader , Hakeem Jeffries , is walking past you , which I would also guess , the House speaker , which you 've been really amazing at getting him to stop the House speaker maybe passing you by , in just a couple minutes as well . Let 's see what this means . with the next step forward , is this head to the Senate lawn . Great reporting as always . Thank you so much , John . . Politico had a great phrase . They called House speaker Mike Johnson . Magic Johnson , which is a nice way of putting it , given how he worked to push this bill through with us . Now , from the white House , a lane , a train and a to the president himself leaned on Republicans to make this happen . Absolutely . And he made it very clear this week , not only did he go to Capitol Hill himself to address the entire House Republican Conference , he also had , House speaker Mike Johnson , as you just referred to , as Magic Johnson at the white House yesterday with some of those hard line , House Freedom Caucus members to really convince them to get on board . And his message was really clear . He said a no vote on this bill would be , , the ultimate betrayal . And so the president made it very clear , if you 're with me , you are going to vote on this bill . And if you 're not , you 're probably going to face , some , some tough rhetoric and potentially , problems down the line from his team here at the white House . if you 're not behind him . And that was really , I think , what helped muscle this bill through . Now , a couple things , of course , to note . One is this bill is really going to be a crowning achievement for president Donald Trump . But something they are talking about repeatedly , this is something they think will be a legacy defining moment for him if it ultimately passes . It has all of the things that he talked about repeatedly on the campaign trail . One , of course , wanting to make sure that his 2017 tax cuts are made permanent . They were supposed to expire at the end of this year . But then also what he talked about with no taxes on tip , on overtime , on Social Security benefits , on , auto loan interest deduction . So all of those things are in this bill . And when I talked to white House officials behind the scenes , they told me that was really what the president cared most about getting his priorities in this . Of course , the sticking points related to how will you pay for this ? And some , , issues that this president may face down the line is how they did ultimately try to pay for this with Medicaid cuts and also cuts to Snap benefits . Many things that people are criticizing already . But the key thing to keep in mind , John , is that this fight is not over . , it is a major success for President Donald Trump , for House speaker Mike Johnson . But this bill is going to face a lot of issues once it gets to the Senate . And it 's probably going to be reworked , in many different ways . And this white House knows that . And they know that they have a lot of work that they still cut out for them , to make sure that this can ultimately get through and ultimately to his desk to sign . But I can tell you they 're going to be very happy with this news . I am sure we are just moments away from having another Truth Social post on this president . , look , it is a big step . There is no question about that . A long way to go . And they do all have to also contend with very jittery bond markets , the great and powerful bond market . Very concerned about what this does to the debt . And at the white House . Thank you very much ."
https://youtu.be/Wox0M7eWXP0?si=1tDVZ1swgsR59Tv3,Market stumbles amid fears Trump tax bill will hurt US deficit,cnn,Wox0M7eWXP0,"A critical meeting is underway at the white House . President Trump hosted members of the House Freedom Caucus , who are still a When it comes to the so - called big beautiful bill to advance Trump 's sweeping agenda . Those holdouts asking for more time and standing in the way of Trump to see that bill passed tonight . I do n't think it can be done tod , the runway is short toda We 're going to work with the president today . We 're going to work with our colleagues to deliver . But there 's a long way to go . There 's some belief in Washington , D.C. , that once today comes and this can not be fixed . This is a completely arbitrary deadline set by people here to force people into a corner to make bad decisions . The two biggest sticking points and clean energy . The hard liners want to see bigger cuts to what they say is fraud , waste and abuse and Medic And they want to see all funding for clean energy programs stripped from the bill . Now , a source inside the adminis telling CNN that the white House previously presented the Freedom with a set of policy options . But going into today 's meeting , there was still no deal . now , the Dow closing down . Now , as here , more than 800 points . That 's just shy of 2 % . The market 's concerned over esti from the Congressional Budget Of that says that this bill will ad 2.3 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years . And that 's a concern that many Republicans , even those who plan to vote for the bill , are sharing . My concern about the deficit and the debt is tremendous . This bill in its entirety , the way it was written , we would go from 36 trillion now in debt to 56 trillion minim in ten years . Currently , the bill spends more than it would than the status qu , so it does n't help deficits . It burst the deficits . I 'm a deficit hawk . I 'm not happy with this bill , but it 's probably the best we 're going to get now . . And the CBO projecting nearly 4 trillion to the deficit over ten years . My panelists here , along with CNN 's Monty Raju , he is live on Capitol Hill . You talk with the speaker just before this meeting . Where do things stand at this ho Yeah , the speaker is still press and the pressure campaign is on . And the hopes that these members who are demanding more time ultimately will bend to Donald Trump 's will and demand and get behind their push to pass this out of the House as soon as tonight . That was a message from Speaker Johnson and his chief deputy , the House Majority Leader , Steve Scalise , as they left for the white House , indicating they still plan to press ahead to keep to their push to try to get this bill out of t before Memorial Day . When I asked the speaker if you would give the hardliners more time to negotiate as they 've been demanding , he indicated it was time to vote again , to put this bill on the floor tonight , or even give the Freedom Caucus more time might be demanding . look , we 're going to have a disc at the white House about that , and we 're trying to get the bill the best possible form . And we 're trying to meet our for the vote , the president 's call for it . We 've been saying this for many and it was even before Memorial And I tend to hope that this go we 've been continuing to work through issues , but we also have known that we got to keep the bill moving because there 's a lot more steps in this process . , the Senate , of course , has to go and do thei , you 've got other thing the debt ceiling in the bil that do have timelines . So you 're going to go tonight , , that 's what we 're moving forward with . But it 's going to require a lot of those holdou to change their positions and get on board . Remember only three Republican defections . That 's all that Johnson can afford to get this over the finish line . And he 's managed to placate conc from the more centrist wing of the Republican conferenc cutting deals on a number of issues , including the amount that people can deduct on state and local taxes . But that deal that he cut mainly with those Northeast Republicans New York Republicans , that caused anger on the because it would increase the pr But the calculation of the leade was cut . A deal with the moderates and hope the conservatives bend to what Donald Trump is dem The question , though , is will they do that in this meeting that has been going on for about Pam . All . We 'll be tracking that meeting at the white House . Thank you so much . My panel joins me now , CNN political analyst and white House correspondent for The New York T as well , in Kano Young 's CNN political commentator Jonah Democratic strategist Adrian Elrod , and CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings . All , so here we have this meeting at the whit with the GOP holdouts . Johnson wants the vote today . Clearly , that does n't seem to be happenin Where do this going , Sco I get there . , it 's intense when you put members of Congress into the white House and get the president , United States , looking them in the eye and sayi do you want to be the Republican that goes home and tells your constituents that the person that stop the America First agenda ? Because I 'm sure that 's the conv that 's happening now . So I have optimism , and I think the speaker 's office from what I can tell , still has that they might get this done he before they leave for the weeken I will just say , whatever they d it still has to go tangle with the Senate . , there 's two parties in Washingto the House and the Senate , and one party will finish and then the other party will ta And and we 'll be having these conversations all summer . But getting over this hurdle to show the Republicans that put all these people in off and progress is a big political for the Republican Party . . And just in terms of the timelin you heard Andy Harris today , the chairman of the Freedom Caucus come out and say , this could be another ten days until we vote on this . You heard representative Chip Roy say we have a long way to go aga This was before their meeting with President Trump at the whit That , of course , could change th I want to listen to this sound from Congressman Harris about th This bill got worse ove There is no way it passes today . And I as I 've said all along , we may need a couple of weeks to iron everything out , but it 's not going anywhere toda What is the significance of that the longer that this goes on ? Jo Well , the problem is the longer these things go on , the harder it gets to get them passed . Righ So I think that 's part of the pull the Band - Aid get this over with , kick it to the Senate . look , my prayers have been from the be Eventually something passes because for the exactly the argument that Scott is makin which is that the stakes for Republicans are s are so much worse if it does n't . So eventually , who knows what deals are going t and all that stuff . , some fiscal conservative . I think this whole thing is a it 's a hate crime , but , it 's going to pass and then the Senate is going to nuts with it and change it in wa that are completely going to ove what the House agreed to . And then you 're gon na have this reconciliation thing . So this is going to be something we 're gon na be talking about on all summer long . Let 's talk about the fiscal conservatism , though , because the CBO came out . That 's the Congressional Budget It 's nonpartisan . It says this bill would force cu to Medicare , will take from the and give to the rich . Nearly 9 million people will los to health insurance . It will increase the deficit by nearly $ 4 trillion . That is what they are estimating , you have to ask about Republicans and being willing to run on that next year . . You have . , one faction that 's obviously concerned about the fiscal nature of this and how much it will cost . But you have also , , conservatives that are also worried about cuts to the social safety net and programs Medicaid and Medicare , and the political backlash that will come with those cuts . those are programs that many of the president 's own supporters also rely on here so you do have those nerves , but this , this whole scenario , we 're talki about the timing of this , when the white House has also made clear that this and the passage of this bill , the president views it almost as a loyalty test here you saw him say yesterday , look , if you do n't want to support thi you might not be a Republican much anymore . There was an OMB Office of Manag and Budget statement that also used the word betrayal , as well . This is this is much stronger than just a message of him sayin , or how are you going to answer your constituents ? He is making clear that he sees the actions of Republicans in Co here as a real measure of their to the white House and to him . . , you saw what he said about Rep M who 's a no on this , who clearly is going to change h that he should n't even be he should be voted out of office is what he said . and we 're also seeing a little b about how Republicans will messa if this does not pass the House . Adrian . . Rep bar from my home state of Ke was on CNN earlier today . And here 's what he said . For the life of me , I do n't know why anyone Democrat or the grand standers would vote against this bill . I think it 's political suicide . Voting against this bill is voting for a $ 4 trillion tax increase . It 's voting for increases on taxes on middle income Americ It 's voting on for tax increases on tips , tax increases on overtime . What do you say to that ? , look , I do n't I do n't understand if you are one of the 12 to 20 or so vulnerable Republicans that , , one in a very marginal district this last time around , how you can go home , look your constituents in the ey many of whom to the point you made earlier , the point you made earlier , our benefit from these social safety net pro benefit from Medicaid benefits from Social Security . And , I voted for the largest , reduction in Medicaid to Medicai in the history since the program has been incep So how do you go home to do that ? And I will tell you this , Scott , Democrats will remember , there will be a lot of money spent in these districts for Republicans who voted for th making sure that every single one of their constituents is aware of the cuts that they made , to their programs and how they are affect their lives adversely . I have no doubt that Democrats will spend money complaining abo because anything that we take from illegal aliens , Democrats , we 're not talking about immigration , about we 're talking about safe . , we 're talking about illegal being kicked off of Medicaid , and we 're talking about able bodied people needing to sh work product here . That 's what we 're talking about in this program . It 's a massive program , and it costs a lot of money , and there 's not even $ 1 trillion added to the debt , according to $ 500 billion of possible waste , fraud and abuse in this p There is there are ways to cut this that does n't impact a single per who needs it . And I would bet that is that this bill is not it would be more than not doing that and run a campaign and say , we took this away from illegal a so we could show it up for you . But that 's not what this bill do That 's not what 's ."
https://youtu.be/BNCWxCSKsLg?si=u_hH-i7tFjP8GZhA,He became political Kryptonite': Enten on Elon Musk's favorability rating,cnn,BNCWxCSKsLg,"So Elon Musk is now saying that he will be spending a lot less of his fortune on politics moving forward . This came out yesterday in a new interview . So why is Musk making this shift ? Now you 'll remember Musk spent more than $ 290 million to help get President Trump and other Republicans elected . Tesla , though , has struggled this year . Really , ever since Musk took a leading role in the Trump White House and began to lead his DOGE efforts . And now , Musk says he 's going to spend more time at least the next few years . Still stay on as CEO of Tesla , something that Harry Enten decided he wanted to look at . What is behind this shift from Elon Musk ? What is behind it ? How unpopular is ? How popular is he ? How low can you go ? . , take a look here Elon Musk net favorability rating . Look at this shift back in 2017 before he really started this politics thing . He was at plus 24 points . Look at where he is now . . He fell through the floor . -19 points among Democrats . The fall was even more dramatic . We 're talking about going from plus 35 points on that favorability rating . That is quite a popular guy among Democrats . To get this now down to -91 points . You ca n't really go lower than that . I guess you could go down to -100 points . But he became political Kryptonite . He was greatly disliked by the American public and greatly , greatly , greatly disliked by Democrats . And obviously we saw that in Wisconsin when , of course , he spent all that money . And then the liberal won that Supreme Court race . . How has that plummet of popularity impacted the brand ? . . Exactly . . So this is Elon Musk individually . How about Tesla . Let 's take a look . The net favorability rating . Look General Motors we 're going to hear General Motors and Tesla . General Motors quite well liked by the American people . Plus 23 points on that favorable rating . But look at Tesla -20 points . So this idea that Tesla could somehow separate itself out from Elon Musk , the American people thought the exact same way . And of course , Tesla is a business . They 're in the business of selling cars . Awfully difficult to sell cars when you have a -20 point net favorability rating , driven by Elon Musk 's net favorability rating around the same mark . And it 's not a big surprise that Tesla sales had fallen in the past , at least in the first quarter , compared to where they were a year ago . It turns out that Elon Musk political Kryptonite was also becoming Kryptonite for selling cars . So well , the and the one person maybe that matters to Elon Musk . Maybe , , other than his investors would be Donald Trump . How is his Trump 's view of him shifted ? . So we 're talking about Tesla here . But of course he 's leaving the political game . Trump loved talking about Elon Musk at the beginning of his administration about Musk on Truth Social . Look at this from January 20th to April 4th . He posted about 40 times . Look from April 5th onward . 00000 . Donald Trump knows brands very well . He knows political brands and , , Elon Musk , political brands . Time had run out . And therefore Elon Musk taking a step back from politics . Also might be a favor to Elon Musk . , I would think so . Much less about me while I 'm trying to save my company . , it seems pretty good . Thank you so much . For putting a break on politics . Accelerating on Tesla Elon Musk says he plans to cut his political spending in the future after he spent a record sum to help get Donald Trump back in the White House . The world 's richest man has been shaking up the federal government through the so - called Department of Government Efficiency . And now , he says he 'll turn his attention back to Tesla and plans to leave the company for at least five more years . CNN media correspondent Hadas Gold joins us now . Hadas , what more did Musk say about his plans ? And it stuck out to me that he definitely kept the door open . He keeps the door open , but it 's stunning to hear from the man who spent more than $ 290 million in 2024 to help elect President Trump and other Republicans , and then he spent millions more on that Wisconsin judge 's race to now say , what ? I 'm done . Take a listen to what he had to say . In terms of political spending . I 'm going to do a lot less in the future . And why is that ? I think I 've done enough . Is it ? Is it because of blowback ? , if I see a reason to do political spending in the future , I will do it . I do not currently see a reason . And I 'm sure many Republicans hearing that will say , wait , wait , wait . There is a reason we have a very slim majority in Congress . We 're going to need your help in the midterms . Now , as you noted , he did leave the door open . But there was , of course , the question of why is he suddenly changing his tune , when six months ago , , just a few months ago , he 's brandishing a chainsaw on stage and seeing so energized about working in politics . Now we can just look at the numbers . First of all , we can look at the approval ratings for Elon Musk . If you look at his approval ratings and polls back in February , his disapproval rating was at 49 % . In just a couple months , it jumped up to 57 % , whereas his approval rating did not move at all . And his work in Washington has affected not only his personal approval ratings , but we 've seen it affect Tesla 's share price as well . I talked to somebody who has spoken to Elon Musk , who 's in his orbit . He said a few reasons why this is happening . He says Elon has too many assets coming to him and everyone sees him as a silver bullet spender . He says that he warrants Elon Musk has not chosen his midterm bets yet , and he says he is sending a message to the market and his shareholders . And as we saw from Tesla 's share price , though , there , Tesla 's share prices have gone up ever since . Elon Musk has said he 's stepping back from politics , guys . All , Hadas Gold , thank you so much . America 's billionaires got a lot richer over the past year . Must be nice . This , as Republicans on Capitol Hill are debating the president 's tax and spending bill that could make the wealthiest Americans even more wealthy while leading to deep cuts in certain safety net programs . Matt Egan here with the latest on this . Good for those billionaires . , John , it must be nice , as you said . But look , this really highlights America 's inequality problem . Oxfam found that the top ten richest Americans got $ 365 billion richer in just the past year . Now , this measures their net worth from April 2024 to April 2025 . And this , of course , comes despite the fact that there was that scary market drop earlier this year . This amounts to these billionaires gaining $ 1 billion collectively each day , which is pretty stunning . And to put a finer point on things here , Oxfam also found that it would take ten typical workers , making median earnings 726,000 years to make $ 365 billion . It 's a mindblowing stat there . Now , as far as who got richer . The top ten list includes legendary investor Warren Buffett . He got $ 35 billion richer over the last year . Jim Walton and Rob Walton , the Walmart heirs , almost $ 40 billion , $ 39 billion from Mark Zuckerberg . But far and away . This list , of course , is led , not surprisingly , by Elon Musk , who got $ 186 billion richer in again just the past year . So I asked the White House about these findings and concerns about inequality and a spokesperson argued that wealth inequality got better during Trump 's first term , and that this legislation being debated by House Republicans would restore prosperity for Main Street . But John , nonpartisan experts , they 're warning that this legislation would in fact make the rich even richer , while simultaneously cutting almost $ 1 trillion from Medicaid and food stamps . , and overnight , we got a new score about how much this legislation will cost . , a lot of money . This is coming from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . They 're finding that this legislation would add almost $ 4 trillion in debt over a decade . this comes completely contradicting what the White House said just the other day , arguing that this would not add to the deficit . Keep in mind , this would just add to the mountain of debt that the U.S. already has . Now , that 's , of course , a bipartisan problem . Republicans and Democrats alike , and share some blame . But this debate over the House GOP tax cuts , it 's coming at a time when there 's growing concerns about the fiscal mess rate . Moody 's just the other day cut America 's perfect credit rating . And there are these concerns that this would also add to inequality . This is the nonpartisan Penn Wharton budget model . They say that the top 10 % of earners would get 65 % of the gains here , and the bottom 20 % , they would lose $ 1,000 each next year due to these cuts to Medicaid . And also food stamps ."
https://youtu.be/exIcGoUT9cg?si=zJ6O384MPSVWQzp-,It's appeasement': Ex-ambassador to Ukraine explains resignation over Trump policies,cnn,exIcGoUT9cg,"We begin in Ukraine . Russia continues to pound the country with drone attacks overnight . And this comes just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to his American counterpart , Donald Trump , clearly demonstrating no immediate end in sight to the hostilities . So what did come of that conversation ? There was no threat of new sanctions on Russia and no demand for a ceasefire . And today , Putin made his first visit to Kursk since Moscow recaptured the region from Ukrainian forces . For one veteran American diplomat , this current order of business is n't acceptable anymore . Last month , Bridget Brink resigned her post in protest over the marked change of policy towards Russia and Ukraine . And she joined me from Washington DC to explain why it matters for America to ensure that Ukraine does n't lose and Russia does n't win the war . It started . Ambassador Bridget Brink . to the program . Thanks so much , Christiane , for having me on . The last time we spoke was when I was in Kiev . You were in Kiev as ambassador , and now you have resigned . You resigned as an active ambassador from Ukraine . Tell me why . , first I 'll start with a little context . So for three years , I served in Ukraine while Russia launched thousands of missiles and drones that killed men , women and children in their homes and apartments , on playgrounds and churches that tried to take the light , heat and power out for a country of 40 million people over three Ukrainian winters . And that committed atrocities and war crimes we have n't seen since World War Two . I fully agree that the war needs to end . But the policy since the beginning of the administration has been to put pressure on Ukraine as the victim , rather than on Russia as the aggressor . And peace at any cost is not peace at all . It 's it 's appeasement . And we all know from history that appeasing aggressors only leads to more war . It must have taken , though , more than just that , to have a career Foreign Service diplomat , as you are , who 's served five different administrations of all different , of both political parties to throw in the towel . , tell me about put that in context in terms of the morality that you summon , the integrity , whatever it is that caused you to make that decision . , I have been very proud to serve five presidents and for 28 years as a career diplomat . and I took a decision , this decision to resign . It was not a quick , hasty decision , but one that I took over the course of the first three months of the administration . And it started . The first sign was the Oval Office meeting , which was horrifying . But there were other signs as well , including the withdrawal of security assistance and intelligence assistance , which was put back on . But that was , a temporary withdrawal that I did disagree with . In addition to that , there was a change in language and discussion about the war . Instead of talking about Russia 's war of aggression in Ukraine , it was the Russia Ukraine war . I believe that the only way to accomplish the goals of the administration of the president to end the war is to call out the aggressor and put pressure on the aggressor , Russia , to come to the table and to end the war that he started . Can I ask you something about the Oval Office meeting , which obviously was that , , debacle in which JD Vance and others started to gang up against Zelensky . At least that 's what it looked . But Zelensky himself could be said not to have comported himself in the most advantageous way . Did you advise him how to behave with President Trump in the Oval Office ? Did anybody suggest that he might get provoked and for him to , , stay calm and maybe even speak in his own language so that he was in full , control of the of the conversation ? , certainly in my position as , the ambassador to Ukraine and at that time , as the president 's representative , I did offer advice as to how to , achieve our mutual goals . And for us and the US side was to end the war for the Ukrainians was to keep us supporting Ukraine . but I think the main issue at play now is what happens next . And where do we go from here ? There 's been some important conversations that have happened , but I think it 's very important that we stick with supporting Ukraine in ways that will help to end the war as quickly as possible . I 'm asked , we 've watched President Trump vacillate in his public , demeanor towards Putin . Sometimes he appears to be offering carrots . They say , to sweeten the pie , in other words , to bring him into talks rather than just alienating him from the beginning . others say that , , he really does believe the Russian narrative , but what he 's done has changed his tone . That was the Oval Office tone . Then there was the Vatican tone when he looked to be much more listening to Zelenskyy . Then there was the Vladimir stop tone , when Putin had sent in a whole barrage of missiles and drones that killed a lot of civilians . What do you . And now he says nothing will change until I meet Putin . What do you think is going to happen next ? , I think to achieve the goal of ending the war , what we need to do as an administration , and my advice would be , to President Trump is to put more sanctions on immediately . The Europeans have just increased sanctions , especially on areas of the energy sector . It 's the oil and the sale of oil that is a big part of fueling the war machine . We have done a little bit of that under the previous administration , but we could do much more . Also , there are other types of sanctions in the banking sector and other things that we could do that could put more pressure on Russia to bring Putin seriously to the table . I also think we need to get at the $ 300 billion , which is , Russian sovereign assets that are mostly frozen in Europe and use those to help Ukraine defend itself , and that can be used to buy weapons in the United States that could replenish our own defense industrial base , but also , help Ukraine be a stronger country against Russia . I 've been speaking to a Russian official who told me , they do publicly , that they do believe that they 're winning , that they believe that . And they know they say despite the casualties , which are huge , that they have pretty much an endless pot of recruits because they pay them . And we know that , the families , , they make that peace with that deal . They get money every time one of theirs goes to the front . they and they have said publicly they have gained several kilometers per day , for the last , , important period of time on the front line into Ukraine . So it does matter which weapons and how the Ukrainians were , were helped when they could have been helped , because we all knew that the Trump administration did n't want to continue this help . So what do you think ? And what do in terms of your latest intelligence readings before you resigned , I suppose , on where the Russians are headed and can they win this war ? I think the Russians , of course , are going to tell us that they think they 're winning . I do think Putin is struggling , the economy is struggling . And that 's why we should double down on efforts to make it harder to wage this war , on efforts that will undercut the war machine that Putin has . He does have soldiers , but he is paying a lot of money for these soldiers and a lot of death benefits for these soldiers . So it 's a very expensive proposition for him . And it 's very hard on his economy . But maybe what I would say , , for the American people just to say why it matters what we do from here and why it matters to America . And there are a number of reasons foreign policy reasons and economic reasons . But first , Putin wo n't stop this aggression . And if he thinks and if he does , if he is successful in changing borders by force and being legitimized for doing that , he will continue . I am sure of that . Based on my decades of experience in the region . It also sends a terrible signal to China and others around the world that will be difficult for us to counteract . It will have global repercussions , repercussions if we see this end in a way where Putin is successful . And third , the EU is our largest trading partner . It 's a $ 1.6 trillion of trade , which fuels 16 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic . This is very important to the United States , and Putin 's goal is to disrupt this relationship and to divide Europe and to divide Europe from us . And then I think there 's an even more important or equally important issue of who we are as a nation and what we stand for . And throughout my career , I have been very proud to serve as a US diplomat under five presidents , where we promoted freedom and we supported democracies around the world . This is who we are , and an America that leads in this way is a strong America with allies and partners . And this is the America we need to preserve and protect . you mentioned Putin trying to divide Europe from the USA . He 's doing a pretty good job that 's a very , very difficult relationship now . I want to ask you , finally , do you think there is anybody in Trump 's inner circle or in his cabinet that has Ukraine 's back ? , I think , , all of us I can speak only for myself as a former official is that what we care about is American interests . We serve American interests . In this case , I think they are the same as Ukraine 's interests to remain a free country , to deter Russia , to send the signal to China . That 's what 's in our interest . That 's what we are focused on . I do believe that ending the war is also in America 's interests . But how it ends is important to us . It 's important to us on a political level and an economic level and on a moral , principled level . It 's important to who we are as Americans . Ambassador Bridget Brink , thank you very much indeed for joining us . Thank you . Christiane ."
https://youtu.be/hYKcrzK7It8?si=_bFayXwLqWlUpoLu,Pentagon says it has accepted jet from Qatar that will be used by Trump,cnn,hYKcrzK7It8,"We do have some breaking news in to CNN . Despite bipartisan criticism , the Pentagon says it has accepted that Boeing 747 jet from Qatar and that President Trump will use it once it has been modified . Trump has been pitching this as a replacement to Air Force One . CNN 's and Tosha Bertrand is live from the Pentagon . Natasha , what are you hearing and talk about some of the various concerns about the president taking this plane . , Brianna , we 're just getting this news in from the chief Pentagon spokesman , Sean Parnell , who told CNN in a statement that , , the Secretary of defense has accepted this Boeing 747 from Qatar in accordance with all federal rules and regulations . He said that the Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the president of the United States . Now , that really gets to the heart of the controversy over this . Not only the possible at this point that this that this is going to be gifted a by Qatar to the Trump administration instead of purchased by the Trump administration , which raises all kinds of ethical questions , but also the fact that being given an aircraft by a foreign government for the president of the United States to use is very dicey to say the least . And it 's going to require extensive modifications to the aircraft before President Trump can even safely use it . And to that end , the Air Force did tell us in a statement that they are preparing to award a contract to a contractor , to a defense contractor , to begin the modifications on this aircraft that will be necessary before President Trump can use it as a temporary Air Force One . Now , we should note that this has , as you mentioned , been mired in controversy for weeks , ever since it emerged that the Trump administration was in these conversations with Qatar about accepting this luxury jet , because President Trump has really been frustrated by the piece of Boeing 's construction of two jets that were going to be the new Air Force One to replace the very aging model that exists now . And so the Trump administration began reaching out and exploring other options . One of those options was this jet that Qatar has been trying to sell . But again , there are still so many questions here . And in fact , a person familiar with the matter poured cold water on the idea that this is going to happen immediately , saying that , look , all the talks about this transfer are still ongoing . There are a number of legal issues that still need to be worked out here . Brianna , , and to get it in operational shape to be an Air Force One will take considerable time and expense . We 'll see that . Natasha Bertrand from the Pentagon , thank you so much . So was it a gift or a request ? There are new questions about that $ 400 million plane that Qatar is apparently prepared to hand over to President Trump as a replacement for Air Force One . Here 's what the president has said about how this offer came about . If I wanted to , I could , , hurt Boeing . And I do n't want to hurt Boeing , but they are very late with the plane . And , Qatar heard about it . And he 's a great leader . And , we were talking and he said , if I can help you , let me do that . And they had a plane . So cutter heard about it . The president 's narrative on how all of this happened is now in dispute , because four sources familiar with the discussions tell CNN that it was Trump 's team that first approached cutter about acquiring a 747 that could be used as Air Force One . CNN chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt joins us now with the details . What are these sources telling us ? So as you heard there from Trump in his telling , it 's Qatar that came to him with this offer . What we 've been told is Trump came into office in January , and not long after that , the Pentagon went to Boeing asking for an update on the new Air Force , ones that are expected in the near future . There are two of them . They were told that they would n't be delivered until 2027 . You can hear their President Trump , rather impatient . So what Boeing did was present the Pentagon with a list of planes that could work as a substitute , and that Qatar plane was on there . And so the Pentagon , with the White House 's backing , went to Qatar and said , we 're willing to consider buying this . And the guitarist said , , we 're willing to consider selling this to you simultaneously . Boris Steve Wyckoff , the president 's Middle East envoy , he had also been asked to put together a possible list of planes . He 's the Middle East envoy , so he helped facilitate these meetings . So this started as a conversation , conversation about some transaction , a lease or a sale . But as you can tell , it 's evolved . We 've heard President Trump talk about , gesture a contribution . once on Truth Social . He wrote that this would be a gift that was free of charge . Now , this may end up being a contribution for which the US pays thing , but this is it 's a lot more nuance . And it really was from what we 're hearing , not Qatar that kick this off , but the U.S. that reached out to them . Theoretically , U.S. taxpayers would be paying something to retrofit this thing because there were security concerns , would have to be taken apart and put back together . What would be the timeline for all of the not just something , but quite a bit , and it could be several times the actual value of the plane . We 've spoken to current and former officials who have said that this could take as much as two years to overhaul this plane . They essentially have to strip it down to the bones to make sure that there are no listening devices or other , security threats on there . Then they have to rebuild it . They have to put all the technical and security specs on there that would be required of a presidential plane . You 'd have , security , law enforcement , a spy , agencies involved in rebuilding this . So that could take up to two years . It could take many times the value of the plane . We believe the planes around worth around $ 200 million . It 's been reported around 400 . So it could take a long time , a lot of money , which may end up not being worth it . So this deal , we 're told , are still being hashed out . It would be the Qatar Ministry of Defense that would be giving or selling it to the US Defense Department ."
https://youtu.be/RbPR-LfUWpo?si=KSqINEtvmKVMYD62,Speaker Johnson aims for House floor vote on Trump agenda tonight,cnn,RbPR-LfUWpo,"Breaking news up on Capitol Hill , where all night negotiations are dragging on and on . now , Republicans are scrambling to shape President Trump 's agenda in his second term . Since 1 a.m. , lawmakers on the House Rules Committee have been debating the president 's sprawling spending bill with tax cuts , and they 're still going at it . This morning , House speaker Mike Johnson says he 's hoping for a floor vote later tonight . But with a razor thin majority , Republicans are trying to bridge deal busting divisions within their own party between hardliners and moderates . CNN ’s chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju , in his usual post up on Capitol Hill . Manu , where do things stand at this hour ? , frantic negotiations behind the scenes happening now . The speaker of the House trying to lock down these final deals , particularly with those conservative hardliners who are concerned about the bill , the impact on the deficit and their belief that it does not cut spending enough . Now , the speaker has had to manage concerns under both the moderate wing of his party and the conservative wing in the party , but he seems to have alleviated some key concerns among the more moderate members who have been pushing for a greater deduction of state and local taxes that their voters have can deduct from their annual taxes . They were able to appear to have reached an accommodation , a deal with that group of members by allowing for a greater deduction of the so - called SALT taxes that people pay . That has led to an increase in the price tag of the overall bill , and caused concerns on the . Just moments ago , one of those hard liners , Ralph Norman of South Carolina , just told our colleague Sarah Ferris , I quote , things are not going well . And at the moment , the speaker also talking to other key conservatives , including Congressman Chip Roy , someone who has raised concerns about the deficit and told me just last night that this bill needs to do far more to cut spending . I have expressed . My . Concern , which is real , that the first five years , first four years in particular , you end up with significant deficits in his first years . And my experience in this town is that when you 're banking on savings in the back half , they do n't materialize . Coming from a swing district , are you worried about the political blowback endorsing some of these pretty controversial proposals ? , I the bill is going to look the way it 's going to at the end , get final bill , get finalized . We 've been very clear on where we stand on this . I think we 've gotten the bill to a place could have looked much different , had myself and others , and I 've been advocating for specifically in the Medicaid area . And that last comment going from wants this committee of vulnerable House Republican indicating he seems to be with the direction of the bill now . But it 's that conservative wing Wolf that 's causing some concerns , including a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last night that estimated the cost of the most recent version of this bill to be at $ 3.8 trillion in adding to the budget deficit . And that 's one issue that members are raising concerns about behind the scenes , Wolf . I know they are . And Manu Raju up on Capitol Hill , thank you very , very much . President Trump 's very massive spending and tax cut bill . Members of the Rules Committee have been meeting since 1:00 Am . As Republicans try to win over their last holdouts . This comes as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a preliminary analysis of the bill , finding that it would increase the federal budget deficit by a whopping three point eight trillion , trillion dollars Joining us now , Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey . Congressman , thanks so much for joining us . As , some hard line conservatives are warning and Speaker Johnson , they still are n't on board . House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris says negotiations quote , got worse overnight . What is your sense of where this bill stands now ? , I think , Wolf , there 's a reason why there 's a war within the Republican Party over this . I think you 've got a lot of Republicans who realize that this is an assault on our seniors and our children . , between the gutting Medicaid , which helps our seniors and nursing homes and our children , especially those who are hungry and need help in health care , , the idea of this bill for a lot of Republicans will be devastating in their districts . And so I think you 're seeing that tension play out . And there 's a good reason for it , Wolf . And it adds , of course , you just pointed out to the debt you 're talking about $ 4 trillion . So not only is it bad economics , but it 's bad policy . And I think that 's why you 'll continue to see a huge fight as this plays out . And you mentioned the Congressional Budget Office analysis . It does not necessarily include the latest changes now being negotiated by representatives , but Republicans are already slamming the CBO analysis . Listen to what Congressman Andy Barr said earlier today . , look , first of all , the CBO score is wrong . The CBO has been wrong repeatedly . It was wrong when they scored the first Trump tax cuts that were wrong by over $ 1 trillion . Why ? Because the CBO does n't do this scoring dynamically . How do you respond to that , Congressman ? , it 's an independent analysis , ? And what I think they came out and said , is this going to hurt the bottom 10 % the worst , . It 's going to hurt children who are hungry . It goes after school breakfast and school lunch . It hurts our seniors and nursing homes . . So I , , they can try to come up with whatever excuse they want about how this is n't bad . But the bottom line is an independent group has said that looks at the analysis , the economic analysis . This is going to not only lead to the debt , but it 's going to be devastating to our families , to women 's health care . It 's going to lose as you probably saw . Also , it 's going to gut manufacturing jobs in the United States . so it 's going to cost hundreds of plants to shut down , plus hundreds of thousands of jobs . So everywhere you look at this , from every angle , this thing is a huge , devastating problem for the country and for the Republican Party . And I think that 's why you 're seeing such a big fight internally in the Republican Party . Very big fight indeed . The House Speaker Johnson tells CNN a tentative deal has been reached a quadruple the current state and local tax deduction limit to $ 40,000 . You 're the co - chair of a bipartisan caucus on that so - called Salt issue . Are you satisfied with that number ? , Wolf , , I 've heard three different numbers this morning already that keeps moving around . , my position is pretty clear . We should bring the state local tax deduction back so that hardworking middle class Americans do n't get taxed twice on the same income . I 've always believed that we should go back to the way it used to be in 2017 , which would help greatly help states mine who , as , greatly subsidize the red moocher states . we pay a lot more to the federal government than they do , and they get a lot more back . So this is just . This makes no sense . What 's being proposed ? I introduced legislation to say , what ? Take the salt issue out of this . Let it go back to the way it used to be . Let people fully deduct what they pay in state local taxes so they do n't get taxed twice on the same income . I 'm talking about cops , firefighters , nurses in new Jersey , teachers . , this is about giving relief for teachers in Jersey . And I know these red moocher states . They just want to take from us even more every day . But the bottom line is you got people me who said , absolutely no way . And you have Republican congresspeople from New York and New Jersey in that area who are also saying what they proposed is absolutely outrageous . , several hard line Republicans have called raising the so - called SALT the state and local tax deduction , a bailout of Democrats overspending in blue states . And they say they wo n't support the change . What 's your response to that ? And how do this very sensitive issue of the Salt deductions playing out ? , first of all , Senator Thune , made it very clear in the Senate that this is going to be a big issue on their side , which is why I still think this fight is pretty early on . But what do I say to these folks from Missouri , Mississippi and Alabama ? Get more than $ 4 for every dollar they send in federal tax dollars to Washington . And states mine in new Jersey get about $ 0.67 of $ 0.70 back for every dollar spent . So these red moocher states , it 's nice that they take , take , take and then turn around and want to stick it to people in my district . Hardworking middle class families is my district . I think it 's absurd . And I 've always said to them , listen , why do you not take a nickel more than you put in to the federal government ? And then we can have that conversation . In the meantime , it is absurd to hurt our cops and teachers and firefighters in Jersey and in and in the Tri - State area . So that 's what I say . , off . , they should really look in the mirror . And another sensitive issue , Congressman , the Congressional Budget Office , the CBO also says the bill would cut an estimated $ 625 billion from Medicaid , largely through , new work requirements that despite President Trump repeatedly claiming Medicaid would n't be , in his word , touched . What 's your reaction to that ? Again , I 'm very confused by that . . You got the president saying one thing . He flip - flopped yesterday on SALT as we were talking about . He 's all over the place on Medicaid . Their party is to which is why they 're fighting . I think if you 're a senior and looking at this or , you have a child who 's on Medicaid , he gets health care that way . I do n't know how you 'd ever support what they 're doing , which is why they 're having such a big fight . You 've got 80,000 people in my district who depend on Medicaid , seniors and children . They rely on SNAP for food and school breakfast and school lunch , and they 're going to rip that away from them . I do n't understand again how they could think that this is going to be good for them . All it does is that this extremist party is hurt families who need help the most . And I 'm talking about seniors . I 'm talking about children . Talk about women 's health care they 're trying to take away . , talking about obviously investments in alternative energy they 're trying to take away . They want to raise taxes on people with electric vehicles . They want to take away , people who are trying to make their homes more energy efficient . They want to take away support tax credits for that . So they 're raising taxes on people , sticking it to seniors , sticking it to hard working families , and of course , really going after children . Know again , this is why they 're fighting they are Wolf hole in the middle all throughout the night . They 're screaming at each other . the extremists versus other extremists because they ca n't figure out how to move forward ."

My guest today is Matt . He 's the owner of Brix Cider in Mount Horeb , Wisconsin . It 's a hard cider manufacturing plant and a farm to table restaurant . Both sounds amazing . Matt . so you make hard cider ? You have the restaurant . I understand it 's your newest product that you 've seen impacted the most by these new tariffs . so tell us about it . And we wanted a bottle . , we have a new product . We 're coming out with . It 's , cream liqueur . . We recently started doing distilled spirits , and , it 's , , we wanted a special bottle for i because , , the craft bev market is so flooded . There 's so much on the , on the m that you need to stand out a lit brought out a little bo that we are going with . It 's a so it 's Wisc and it 's a cream liqueur . So we wanted something that looked an old time mil , the milkman used And I could n't find a bottle made by US manufacturer that would fit that vibe , other than one that was , , we 're a small place , and I was one that would do a hu that was too much for us . , we do n't have the space for it or the money for it . So I ended up finding , producer in China that makes it and , , put the down payment down , , a little a little before the tariffs went completely nuts And then , , then we pause the order af it was up to 145 % . And now we 're not we 're moving a with the order and it 's . , , , I 've been watching thi show a bit . I watched some of the other segm I 'd say we 're not , we 're not one of the companies that 's being absolutely crushed by tariffs or also not one of those rare on That 's happy about it . I 'd say it 's , , we 're in that majority of it 's getting hurt more than we 're getting helped . And we 're really grateful for , we 're part of the grou Main Street Alliance . and they 're representing small b and they 're , they 're seeing what we 're doing , and they 're seeing their , members struggle . And so they 've been really fighting hard for us , trying to really change these policies . What 's the impact been on your on your prices , both for the cream liquor and also the rest of what you ma . , there 's the , there 's the direct we 're going to pay the tari on the cream liqueur and that 's going to impact our p So it 's going to be about , , once this thing is printed and shipped to us , it 's about , $ 2 a bottle with the custom printing and everything . And then the tariff . What 's if it 's if it 's still 30 % , we 'll see if it 's that would be about $ 0.60 a bott that we 'd pay extra . That 's , , it 's a tax . It 's a sneaky tax . and we would probably have to up at least $ 0.60 on the price for that bottle . and then , , the , the who or the distributor would work wi they would mark up , they 'd markup based on a percent And then the , retailer is going based on a percentage . So , , you 're gon na end up seeing that one thing , it 'll it 'll go up about a dollar a bottle . So it 's just , , in addition to your sa you 're getting this , , dollar a bottle tariff tax on it . . And then , , but then there 's other indirect ways we 're getting tariff , , I just bought some boxes yesterd where I 'm not importing them , but I noticed the price get tick . and , , we 're we buy a coffee from a local cof roaster , and their prices are go because , , you ca n't get American grown cof other than maybe Hawaii , but most of it 's from overseas . So we 're seeing other prices ticking up . and , , we do n't have a ton of wiggle ro as a small business . We have to just move those prices up accordingly ours Very interesting . the restaurant one more time for near the Mount Horeb , Wisconsin area , it 's Brix It 's west of Madison . Go check it out . Matt . Thank you so much . Great having you really apprecia No major price hikes at Home Dep but the company does expect some from President Trump 's sweeping In an earnings call today , executives said they don ' to pass on price hikes to consum But supply chain issues may mean some products may not be availab Leaders worry that could weaken consumer confi This as a number of other compan react to the tariffs with price increases in the United States . Japanese automaker Subaru among the latest to join that group yesterday . Joining me now to discuss is Gen He 's executive director of the Port of Los Ange He joins us there from the port , as you can see . So , Gene , Walmart and Home Depot have both cited issues with the supply chain in their recent earnings calls . What have you seen at the Port of Los Angeles in recent weeks to indicate the effect these tariffs are having on prod You 're good evening , Jake . What we 're seeing now is that the month of May will sh 20 % of our vessel arrivals cance the first and last week of May , down precipitously more than 30 % year soft month overall June , we 're still expecting to be lighter than normal because these tariffs are still very high for importers to purchase goods . Has the 90 day change that pause that Trump ins from the 145 % tariffs on China , down to 30 % . Has that had any impact on impor You 've got some importers now , Jake , trying to scoop up the goods that were already made sitting on factory floors at the 145 % level , and think of parts that are going to American facto because it 's very expensive to s Allied hospital supplies to make sure that we 've got those medical goods in place to care for patients , and then maybe some hyper sensitive seasonal items . But now , what most companies are telling they 're doing the math . Do they roll the dice now and purchase at an average of averages 30 % ? Maybe not . Maybe they wait till the end of but that 's typically the amount it takes the entire order cycle process to take effect from order to completion , and then sailing . So these are really going to be difficult choices for a lot of American importers . What are you projecting in terms of imports as we move into the summer ? It 's going to be lighter than no May is traditionally the month where purchase orders go in for the all important year end holiday seasons . At these prices . Jake , what I see are folks carrying less inventor fewer selections on shelves , and likely higher prices for American consumers . Are you able to tell if there are specific goods that have been impacted more tha now ? It 's a little bit early , but I was just talking with a part supplier to the big 3 to 4 GM , Dodge and Their products now have 57.5 % tariffs on them selling to the big OEMs . So it 's going to be just all ove the board . We 've got over a trillion stock keeping units that come through the Port of Los Angeles . With all these containers . It 's going to be really hard to pass this apart . Really . I think the goods coming in are going to be based on need contracts in place and what 's got to keep this economy moving . Packages worth $ 800 or less coming from China still have a tariff of 54 % down from the pre negotiation level of 120 before Liberation Day , April 2nd They used to be duty free thanks to a tax policy called the de minimis loophole . How much do you think the tariffs on those goods is affecting imports now ? That 's Jake , and I hear from folks across the country that they 're going to be purchasing less of those . And the people that are in charge of distributi think of UPS and Fedex ground he in the United States are also forecasting lighter del of those parcels coming in from Simply based on the cost and low consumer willingness to spend ."

These officials caution it is not clear Israeli leaders have made a final decision , and there is deep disagreement within the U.S. government about the likelihood of such an attack . However , the U.S. assessment is based on both inte Israeli communications and on Israeli military activity including the movement of air mu and completion of an air exercis One person familiar with U.S. intelligence on these issues told us , , the chance of an Israeli strike on an Iranian nuclear facility has gone up significantly in recent months , and the prospect of a Trump negotiated U.S. Iran deal that does not remove all of Iran 's uranium makes the chance of a st more likely . My sources tonight , Jameel Jaffer , founder of the National Security Institute at George Mas University , former senior counse to the House Intelligence Commit and Sabrina Singh , former deputy Pentagon press secretary and now a CNN contributor . Good to have you both here . Sabrina . Would Israel strike Iran over U. objections ? And we should be clear , President Trump has sometimes threatened military action as we But there 's been some reporting that he does not want to see a war in the Mid I think that 's very clear that the president has made that he does not want to see a war in the Mid And I think if Israel were to strike Iran 's nuclear facilities or capabilities , not only would that widen the perspective of war or prospect of war , but that also just flies in the of what this administration is looking to accomplish with Ir which is this tentative nuclear at this moment , though , of course , Israel is viewing Iran as politically , militarily and economically weakened . So they 're seeing this as a chan to further weaken their capabili But again , that 's really going to widen the for a potential war in the Middl And Israeli sources told me that the Israeli position is ess if the U.S. were to make a deal , it 's a bad deal in their eyes that it just gives up too much and allows Iran to maintain too much of a nuclear program from the Israeli objectives , then they might very well strike Is that is that Israel 's concern here , that Trump may so want a deal that he would resurrect the JCPoA ? , this is this is exactly the problem , rig I think the problem is that you saw Steve Wyckoff in the Middle East a few weeks a talking about allowing Iran have 3.67 % enriched uranium That 's a huge problem . That looks a lot the Obama nuclear deal that Trump got rid of . And Israel 's is what was completely opposed to a that looks that . They do n't want that . So now Wyckoff back in the Middle East . the president also sayin no enrichment rights . Marco Rubio had said a few weeks and been in , , in contrast to the administration . So we 'll see what happens . But you got the Supreme Leader s we 're not doing a deal without enrichment . So now you 've got the two countr at odds . Israel might be using this opportunity to message the Do n't do a bad deal . , exactly . , they coul , there 's always an element of sig in all this , but let 's gamed thi If Israel were to go ahead and strike , how would Iran be likely to resp , they are severely weakened militarily and not only Iran , but their proxy groups . , Hezbollah in the north has been decimated by the Israeli military . Of course , Hamas has been comple , I would say destroyed , even thou , Israel continues to conduct operations against Hamas leadership . And then their proxy groups are significantly weakened in Syria and Iraq . And you 're also seeing the Houth also pulling back their capabili So Iran , , on the on its world st does n't is not the same power that it was before October 7th . And I think Israel sees that and is trying to take advantage But I think certainly that flies in the face of what the Trump administration is trying to accomplish . Where would the U.S. be in danger if Israel were to strike in danger of retaliation ? Could we assume that Iran would whether the US was directly invo or not , that indeed the US was involved , or gave some green or yellow light to this operatio I think that 's exactly . I think you 'll see terrorist attacks around the glo Iran would activate its networks weakened though they are around the globe , including the United States . We know that Iran has tried to undertake actual . , murder attacks in the United States against U.S officials and the against Saudi offic So we know that they think they 're trying to establish a capacity here , whether it be successful or not is a different question . But they certainly will try to l The biggest challenge for Israel though , is how much of the Iran nuclea can you get to ? They do n't have the US Massive Ordnance Penetrator , a 33 , 30,000 pound bomb . We 're not likely to give it to t or the B-2 spirit that would del And so they 're have to undertake , probably some commando along with along with bombing strikes and a huge variety of attacks in order to really do damage . And even that is only a few year of stalling . . And so that 's , I think , the hardest part for Is if you take it out , how much can you get of it ? They might still do it . , they 've taken out the air defenses and take out Syria 's air defense but it 's a stalling game at the end of the day for them . And they 've carried out quite aggressive operations , for instance , inside Syria . Righ including a ground element . Jamil , Sabrina , thanks so much to both of you . Israel tonight , making preparations for a possible strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities . This is according to new intelli obtained by the U.S .. It is a brazen , dangerous move that would signal a major break with the Trump administration and obviously could lead to a much wider war . Jim Sciutto is breaking this news is OutFront now . And , Jim , as you 're getting more details here coming in , what more can you tell us about this alarming intelligence Well , this new intelligence includes , both intercepted Israeli communications and observations of Israeli military movements that could suggest an imminent s Multiple sources familiar with the intelligence tell myself and my colleagues , K Lillis and Natasha Bertrand . Among those military preparation the U.S. has observed , the movement of air munitions , as well as a completion of an air exercise . We should note officials are cau it is not clear Israeli leaders have made a final decision and there is disagreement within government about the likelihood that Israel will ultimately take However , and I 'm quoting here from one of the officials , the chance of an Israeli strike on an Iranian nuclear facility has gone up significant in recent months , and the prospect of a Trump negotiated U.S. , Iran deal that does not remove all of Iran 's uranium makes the chance of a st more likely . That 's the situation as we know and obviously extremely alarming given the premise there . Unless you remove all of the ura which is not in the world that we live in , at least currently , does n't seem to be on the table . So I guess the real question is Jim , would Israel , do this ? They need would need American su in some sense it would seem . But would they do this to fly in the face of Trump seems to want ? Fair point . Such a strike would certainly be a brazen brea with President Trump . These officials in knowledge . However , an Israeli source tells CNN that Israel would be prepared to carry out military action on if the U.S. were to negotiate what this source described as a bad deal with Iran , that Israel can not accept . We should also note , and this well , Aaron , that Trump himself has publicly threatened military action against Iran if these new nuclear negotiation and in a letter to the Iranian supreme leader back in March , Trump said a 60 day deadline for those efforts to succeed that , according to a source familiar with that communication , it 's now been 60 days since that letter was delivered , so we should keep that timeline as well as both Israel and the U watching Iran very closely . All . Jim Sciutto , thank you very much with these breaking details this I want to ask you also in the context of the armed serv Committee on which you sit , which I mentioned at the top the breaking news . Jim Sciutto was just reporting the new intelligence suggesting that Israel is preparing a possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities , that would be a brazen break wit That 's the U.S. officials are saying that he 's been working on that diplomatic deal with Iran . The question for you , Congressman , is at this point , from the information that you have in armed services , does Trump have any sway on Netanyahu at th He does . , they 're obviously dependent on the United States for aid , for support . And I praised President Trump recently saying that he was trying to get an Iran deal . In fact , some people in my own party criticized me for that . But it would be a disaster or to have Netanyahu launch a st Most military experts do n't beli would be effective , just given how dispersed a lot of Iran 's sites And the fact is that some of them are in population centers based on public reporting . So it is it is my view that Donald Trump should make it that 's not good for stabili By the way , it 's not good for oi prices , gas prices . The one thing Trump does underst is the economy as a consequences of a war . And I 'm very hopeful he 'll stand up to t Hawks in his own party and stand up and make it clear to Netanyahu , this is not this is not something America wa"
https://youtu.be/qz5yP218V4Q?si=Ev3DdNenCai0HDuO,Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial takeaways: Cassie Ventura’s mom and exotic dancer testify,cnn,qz5yP218V4Q,"The prosecution tried to connect the dots between his business and his alleged abuse of Cassie and another victim . How ? By using witnesses to try to link Diddy to firearms cash and control . We heard from a male escort who said Diddy controlled everyt about some freak offs with Cassi and Cassie 's mother . She also took the stand testifyi about taking a home equity loan out to wire Diddy $ 20,000 . Now , the last went on the stand . He tied it to some pretty serious weapons . Remember that 2024 raid on his home in Miami B Special Agent in charge testified that he found parts of AR 15 rifles in Diddy 's master b He says the serial numbers were also scratched off . Police also found items that oth previously testified would be present at freak offs high heels , sex toys , baby oil , astro glide and linger And speaking of those items , ton we 're seeing images from the fir of what investigators found at the New York hotel where he was arrested last year . They seized . Perhaps you guessed it , baby oil , lubricant , drugs a Now that lines up with what did his former assistant testified to today at trial . He said he was tasked with stocking Diddy 's hotel room We say he did n't go through the company to get reimbursed for these supp Instead , he went to the security and claimed that they would pay him back in from the rapper 's Louis Vuitton He also testified that the bag could hold $ 10,000 or more in ca Telling the court you think because they were items that he did n't want to have a record Now , one of today 's other witnesses was a male escort known as the Punisher , a nickname he says comes from his basketbal playing days . He took part in Diddy 's freak offs with Cassie as well . And he said Diddy would direct all aspects of those encounters . The escort testified , , Diddy when at some point come into the room , sit in the distance , give subtle directions to Miss V based on , I said , angles and lighting , positioning and sometimes the sexual activit We also heard from Cassie 's moth who testified about a payment that she wired to Diddy after Cassie told her that he was threatening to release two sex tapes . Cassie 's mom said that he asked for money around that same time to , , recoup money that he had spent on her daughte The prosecutor asked , , why did you go to the bank and take out a $ 20,000 loan ? Cassie 's mom said , I was scared for my daughter 's She was asked what she needed $ 20,000 for , and she said to pay Sean Combs . And when she was asked why she had to pay Sean Combs , she testified because he demande Now , the prosecution made a bombshell reveal over who we can expect to testify this week . They planned to call Scott Mescu him as Kid Cudi . Remember , Cassie testified that Diddy got irate when he found out she was dating Kid Cudi . The prosecution also plans to call a clinical psychologist , as well as a former Diddy employ who quit , apparently after allegedly witnessing physical abuse . Let 's get to CNN 's Elizabeth Wag Meister , who saw all the testimony in the courtroom today , has been following so clo The assistant , the former one , David James , took the stand today about an incident that could have turned and it involved a rival of Diddy Should I describe ? . So with putting this witness on the stan it appears that the prosecutors are really trying to get into this racketeering claim , showing that they allege Diddy was running this criminal enterprise through his businesses . So this former personal assistant , he worked for Diddy from 2007 through 2009 . He was hired by a bad boy . So an employee of that company , of course , the company that Diddy was the head of . Now this instance that you broug he told this story to the jury , which was after a late night recording session in the studio . It was about 3 or 4 a.m. , and Diddy said he wanted some late night f from Mel 's Diner , a famous place in Los Angeles . So they go to Mel 's Diner . It 's the assistant and one of Diddy security person who they called drop . They get there and they see Shug Knight , as you said . Shug Knight , of course , is a lon rival of Diddy . , they go back to Diddy 's home in the Hollywood Hills . This is when the personal assist he saw Cassie outside the home filing with Diddy arguing , pleading for him not t But Diddy wanted to go . So according to this former assi Diddy said , we 're taking this car , drive the they get in the car , the assista He turns around , looks in the ba and Diddy has three handguns on That is what he testified today . They go back to the diner . Shug Knight is no longer there , but he said that Diddy was deman yelling at him , saying keep driving around . He wanted to find him now . Again , nothing happened because he was n't there . But here 's what the assistant sa on the stand . . I was really shook up by it . , this was the first time being Mr Combs , his assistant , that I realized that my life was in danger . He said that after that , he put in his notice at the company . He stayed for about six more mon to try to train his replacement , but that was really the end for of why he wanted to work there . There was no witness today that we heard from Cassie , even to his mom , which the defense did n't want to hear from . And a lot of people thought , I wonder why she 's testifying . Would it be gratuitous in some w Would she move the needle in either direction ? But she talked about being scare for her daughter 's safety and this $ 20,000 loan . What happened ? So let me get to that in a secon But first , I want to read you an email that was shown to the jury as an exhibit in court . This is an email that Cassie sent to her mother and Capricorn Clark , who was one of Diddy 's employees here under an alias , under an alias . And , here 's what she wrote . The threats that have been made towards me by Sean Puffy Combs are that he is going to release two explicit sex tapes of me , one on Christmas Day , maybe before or after , and another sometime soon after He also said that he will be having someone h me and Scott Mescudi you said Ki physically , he made a point that it would n't be by his hands . He said he 'd be out of the country when it happened . So Cassie 's mom testifies on the stand when she read this email . She was physically ill . And of course she would be . This is her daughter . She 's scared for her life . So then she said that Diddy dema that she pay $ 20,000 , as you said , because he was upse that Cassie was with another man That would be Kid Cudi . And he said , I spent $ 20,000 on your daughter so you better pay it back . Now you have Diddy , who at one point was a billionaire , but at this point at least , is w hundreds of millions of dollars and is allowing the mother of his girlfriend to take out a home equity loan to wire the money . He accepted that money , but then he sent it back . Now I want to bring up one more There are photos of Cassie with bruises on her body that were shown to the jury , and Cassie 's mom said she 's the one who took those photos of her dau when she visited home for Christ It 's pretty unbelievable to think about the dynamic of Sean Diddy Combs asking someone for $ 20,000 for information , of course , that he returned it l when he and Cassie were back tog in some way . What about Kid Cudi ? Are we really going to hear him We are , according to prosecutors , this w as you said , the big reveal toda So Kid Cudi could be on the stan as soon as tomorrow . Laura , we may be seeing him tomo if not , they said Thursday , but definitely this week he is expected to testify . Now , what will we hear from him ? We 're going to hear probably a corroborating account to what Cassie said . Watch as I just got into , she was dating Kid Cudi for a brief moment in 2011 when her and Diddy were what she was on a break , but a rough patc They were together very briefly and did he got back together . But Cassie testified last week that when Diddy found out that she was dating Kid Cudi , he got enraged . He threatened her safety , as we saw in this email . And he even said that he wanted to blow up Kid Co Now , Kid Cody has said around the time that allegation came out , which first was revealed in Cash Civil suit back in November 2023 , Kid Cudi said that is all true . So it 'll be pretty amazing to see that moment in court . If he confirms in front of the j that his car was blown up ."

The New York Times came out with shortly before airtime . A Burmese immigrant apparently put on a plane bound for South Sudan or Myanmar The government 's lawyer claims the second . The man 's lawyer says the first judge , Brian Murphy , threatening to hold officials in contempt , warning the administration and it apparently violated an or he issued in April barring this person 's deportatio without first giving him time to challenge his and ordering officials to locate the plane . Quoting now from the Times courtroom account during the hearing , Judge Murphy ordered a lawyer for the Justice Department , alienist and Perez to notify everyone involved in the flight to South Sudan from the pilot of the plane to o in the Department of Homeland Security , that they could face criminal contempt sanctions if his ruling was not followed . He also instructed Miss Perez to find out exactly where the plane was and whether it could be turned around mid - flight , and Miss Perez told the judge she did not know where the plane More now on this man 's case and that of another person from who apparently suffered the same CNN 's Priscilla Alvarez and Jeff Zeleny are with us now . There 's a lot that is murky abou We 're just figuring out Priscill But what do we know about why these migrants were allegedly deported despite the judge 's order ? , Don , all of this unfolded very quickl over the course of the day . We initially saw those court filings earlier this afternoon , but this is something that began on Monday and really took off on Tuesday . Here 's what the court documents There are declarations here from attorneys from a of the Bur Burmese national that you 're ref to there , and a Vietnamese natio But they say , John , that there could be ten others who were on this flight . They say to South Sudan now , in of the Burmese national , what the attorney for that natio is that on Monday , he was notified that he was going to be deported to South Sudan . He 's not proficient in English . He was advised , or he was notified by Ice while he was in detention of thi without an interpreter . And this really set off a chain of events of his attorneys trying to figure out why he would be sent to South Sudan . He did have a removal order , but to his own country , not to another one . Now , his attorney says that she an appointment to meet with him virtually this morning . Was he checked the detainer locator this morning ? That 's essentially the detention to see where people are . He was no longer there . And when she emailed , Ice , they said the officer respo quote , South Sudan . When she asked where he was remo So you can see why there is so much confusion as to where these detainees who just yesterday were in the detention system , are now no longer there . Now the attorneys are trying to scramble to figure this out , because even though some of these migrants did have removal orders and could be deported , the question here is where were they deported to ? Because if they are sent to a third country , in this case South Sudan , then they would have had to go through a process they would have had to be notifi they would have had the ability to contest their removal to this all of that appears to not have happened , which is why we are seeing all o unfold in these court filings and in the courtroom . I will also tell you , John , the Department of Homeland Secur has not publicly confirmed a fli to South Sudan , a place that has been on the cusp of civ and where the U.S. advises Americans not to travel to because of the ongoing armed conflict there . So certainly a scramble is still unfolding at this hour , John , as attorneys try to figure out where people who they knew were are suddenly nowhere to be found in the U.S. system . , it is confusing . So , Jeff , has the Trump administration made any comment on these alleged deportations ? Because this is obviously not the first time they have found themselves in th of a face off with the judge . as of now , John , tonight . , the white House has not comm on this broadly . The administration has not eithe And you 're , it is a very familiar story . As Priscilla was just laying out We have heard this before . If this sounds familiar , it is . The countries are different . The locations are different . To Priscilla 's point there at the end , South Sudan is on the cusp of a civil war and there is a travel warning ag visiting there . So that certainly is one point h But , the administration is not responding to this . They simply this is one more example of how the immigration procedures are operating in the shadows in many respects . But the events of the a courtroom in Boston that were a relayed by the New York Times and the official records show that the judges one more judge is increasingly becoming exasperated and angry with the Trump administration , with the DOJ lawyers for their responses or lack of r And we 're told there is another hearing tomorro to get more responses to this . So this is very much an ongoing story , John . All . We will learn more , no doubt , in the coming hours . Priscilla Alvarez , Jeff Zeleny , we really appreciate your report on this . With us now is Senator Richard Blumenthal , a Democrat from Connecticut who sits on the Judiciary and Armed Services Committee , among others . Senator Blumenthal , very nice to So look , there 's many levels to this stor If there was a plane with migran sent to South Sudan deporting people to South Sudan , what 's your response to that ? Sending people to who are n't from South Sudan ? We think to this nation which is on the verge of a civil if those individuals were on a plane sent to South Sudan , it seems a violation of the cour Judge Murphy ought to be really His order has been violated , and he ought to consider a contempt of court motion . And no doubt the plaintiffs or considering it But very seriously , violation of court orders ought to be treated with the utmost of sanctions , because otherwise the law is dead . Letter court order aside , and I 'll come back to that in a Why do you think South Sudan , as a nation , to deport people to if they are not , in fact , Sudane John , , it 's inexplicabl except that so much of the lawlessness occurring in connection with these deportations is cruel and dumb . And so the only explanation could be that it was a way of so punishing them for being illegally in the count to send them to a place where they could be easily subject to persecution , torture , killing And that is the fate , by the way , that they also impose on Afghan who helped our servicemen and women in Afghanis , and as well as protecting diplom who are in this country on temporary protected status . And they are now the administration threatening to eliminate that TPS status , send them back to the Taliban , where they have targets on their back , cruel and dumb , really inexplica If there is a subset of people that are easier to vet , who we have a better understanding of who th and what they 're going to do when they come here , they 're going to receive prefere CNN 's Larry Meadow now digs into the reality of what 's going on in South Africa . White South Africans , many of them farmers . And to the American dream , some too young to know . They 've also entered an international firestorm . . to the United States of The U.S. government says it 's taking in these refugees fleeing alleged racial discrimination at home . And that 's why they 've opened the door for them And and they do n't fit that bill Those people who have fled are not being persecuted . the American government has got the wrong end of the sti South Africa 's president has come to the U.S. to set the record straight , and is expected to meet Presiden Donald Trump Wednesday , hoping to reset the two countries relationship . It was his signing of a controversial land seizure law in January that invoked Trump 's , allowing the states to take unused farmland without compensation if deemed just , equitable and in the public interest . South Africa 's majority black population still owns just a small percentage of farms more than 30 years after apartheid officially ended While most are owned by the white minority , there were 36 modest farms between April and December last but only seven of the victims were farmers , according to polic But President Trump calls it a , , genocide against white farmers . They 're being killed and we do n't want to see people be killed . That 's a genocide that 's taking The accusation , partly stemming from this apartheid era song made popular again by far left opposition leader Julius Malema .

https://youtu.be/gpSP9ajdpyk?si=InG2FsMqXAE8-Vn9,James Comey reacts to accusation he called for Trump's assassination,cnn,gpSP9ajdpyk,"The deputy director of the FBI , Bongino , is warning of copycats sending threats to public figure mimicking a now deleted social media post from former FBI director James C Comey shared this image of seash spelling out 8647 , where the president , his allies say amounts to a call for his assassination , something the former FBI directo He was interviewed by the Secret Service on Friday . Now , while there 's some debate about the origins of the phrase , the number 86 more typically refers to running out a restaurant menu item or banning someone fro Donald Trump is the 47th preside For his part , Comey says he came across the sh already arranged , and while he recognized them to be a political message , it had nothing to do with violen he said . He is also the author of a new l thriller , FDR drive , and the former FBI director , James Comey joins me now . going to get to new book in a mo FDR drive . But when you posted this message and I said , there are different interpretations of it , but one interpretation of it is someone or something . Was there anything in the back of your mind that sa maybe I just should n't post this , nothing because it seemed entirely innoc and clever to me . I have never and still Do n't associate 86 with violence because I heard that some folks whether they do that reasonably I do n't want any part of it . And so that 's why I took it down from my Instagram account . , you are held to , I think , a different standard , that you 're in the spotlight in a way that a lot of people ar Do you think that makes it even more incumbent on you to be careful about things Sure . If you have any inkling that there 's a problem . But they were talking about seas at the beach that my wife and I stood over trying to understand what it was and she said , just what you said in the intro , which is she was a long time ser when we were in school . And she said , , that used to there was a kitchen and a phrase to say 86 , meaning to get it off the menu . And I thought , , that 's a clever political message . Never occurred to me . I still does n't that it 's associated with violen It still does n't , even though people have pointed that it has been used in that context . , I 've never seen it used in that context or heard it using that context . But still , how was your interview with the Secret Service about th , good . Their total pros worked with Secret Service for many , many years , and they ask the questions trying to understand why I did i We had a very similar conversati to the one you and I just had . did you leave thinking that they believed you , or do you leave thinking they still had concerns ? I well , I do n't have any reason to believe they do n't believe me And so I feel they ask the questions , and I ca n't imagine they 'll be any more on it . your book is about protected speec When protected speech becomes political violence , is that a fair way to characteri It 's about a putting an extreme or , who talks about things And then there acts of political violence . . It 's about a wing extremis trying to motivate followers to violence through his word and his broadcast . It 's interesting that your book is about that . And now there is this discussion about speech , things said and whether it can be motivating toward violence . . . Not interesting to me . A bit of a bit of a distraction , but the book 's about an important question . I do n't see the social thing as an important issue , but I hope folks will read the b and see that it 's a it 's a great thriller , but it 's also about things that are important and current . How challenging is it to write political fiction when it seems almost every sensational political event that could happen has happened in real life ? , and some of the stuff that goes on , . A journalist being invited to a signal chat , if you put it in your novel , your editor would say , come on , cut that out . This is fiction , but it 's got to So truth continues to surprise and be stranger than I 'm trying to write very real fi so show people what it 's really inside these investigations . And it , often , reflected in real life in ways you would n't expect . You think your fiction is more m than real life at times ? Is that I think it 's probably , because some of the things that we 've seen , I would n't have imagined to put in a book . Talk to me about your view of the type of people who are part of this Trump administration , compared to the first Trump administration . What differences do ? I think they had more talent , smarter people . The first time they had people w willing to go along be a little bit sycophantic , but they were people who had the skills to try and pr institutional interests , to distract the president , to lead him off to something to avoid doing things that were did n't make sense in light of the obligations they had to lead institutions the FBI or DOJ . And that 's gone . It 's it 's Four Seasons , total landscaping all the way do It 's sycophants . It 's people who will try and please the president . And so that 's I never thought I 'd say we missed the old gang from Trum 1.0 , but I do . Kash Patel is the director of th There are some reports he misses some morning briefings He 's very visibly been at a lot of sporting events out there in the public . how concerned are you about that And what do you think the rank a the FBI sees there ? I 'm not the least bit concerned about that , given that nothing in his life will have prepared him to be FBI director . I 'm fine . If he is out doing other things and letting the career people make the decisions about operations , about priorities that would be better for everybo do you think the career people are making the decisions behind the scenes ? Hard for me to say . , I 'm sure they are , because they know what they 're d So if you 're going to if you 're going to go from being an outsider who knows nothing about the institution to the inside , you 're going to have to rely on the career people . What are the things we live with in there ? Still murky details about this , the possibility that federal pro flouted a federal judge 's order , the federal judge seems to think that it 's possibl that they flouted his order , and they may have deported some migrants to South Sudan . The idea of flouting a federal judge 's order seems to be something more now , or more discussed or not as foreboding and maybe as it used to be . What do here ? Do prosecutors willing to push the envelope more ? I ca n't tell . There 's certainly a lot of aggressive rhetoric in but it is suicidal from a career perspecti For a lawyer for the United States Department of Justice to violate knowingly violate a court order , there will be consequences . That will be life changing for that lawyer . And so I do n't know whether we'v from a lot of aggressive talk , which is characteristic of the Trump world to lawyers making that life changing decisi FBI director , former FBI Director James Comey , author of FDR drive . , good luck out there with a book . Thank you so much . Good to be wi"
